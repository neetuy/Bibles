<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_1" data-id="EK15_1">Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_2" data-id="EK15_2">"Son of man, how is a vine better than any tree with branches that is among the trees in a forest?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_3" data-id="EK15_3">Do people take wood from a vine to make anything? Or do they make a peg from it to hang anything on it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_4" data-id="EK15_4">See! If it is thrown into a fire as fuel, and if the fire has burned both of its ends and also the middle, is it good for anything?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_5" data-id="EK15_5">See! When it was complete, it could not make anything; surely then, when the fire has burned, then it still will not make anything useful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_6" data-id="EK15_6">Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: Unlike the trees in the forests, I have given the vine as fuel for fires; I will act in the same way toward the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_7" data-id="EK15_7">For I will set my face against them. Though they come out from the fire, yet the fire will consume them; so you will know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_8" data-id="EK15_8">Then I will make the land into an abandoned wasteland because they have committed sinâ€”this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."</span>
