<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_10" data-id="LV27_10">The person must not alter or change such an animal, a good one for a bad one or a bad for a good.

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_11" data-id="LV27_11">However, if what the person has vowed to give Yahweh is in fact unclean, so that Yahweh will not accept it, then the person must bring the animal to a priest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_12" data-id="LV27_12">The priest will value it, by the market value of the animal. Whatever value the priest places on the animal, that will be its value.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_22" data-id="LV27_22">If a man sets apart a field that he has bought, but that field is not part of his family's land,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_23" data-id="LV27_23">then the priest will figure the valuation of it up to the year of Jubilee, and the man must pay its value on that day as a holy gift to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_24" data-id="LV27_24">In the year of Jubilee, the field will return to the man from whom it was bought, to the land's owner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_25" data-id="LV27_25">All the valuations must be set by the weight of the sanctuary shekel. Twenty gerahs must be the equivalent of one shekel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_26" data-id="LV27_26">No one may set apart the firstborn among animals, since the firstborn already belongs to Yahweh; whether ox or sheep, it is Yahweh's.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_27" data-id="LV27_27">If it is an unclean animal, then the owner may buy it back at the valuation of it, and a fifth must be added to that value. If the animal is not redeemed, then it is to be sold at the set value.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_28" data-id="LV27_28">But nothing that a man devotes to Yahweh, from all that he has, whether human or animal, or his family land, may be sold or redeemed. Everything that is devoted is very holy to Yahweh.</span>
