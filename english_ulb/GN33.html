<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_1" data-id="GN33_1">Jacob looked up and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him were four hundred men. Jacob divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two female servants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_2" data-id="GN33_2">Then he put the female servants and their children in front, followed by Leah and her children, and followed by Rachel and Joseph last of all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_3" data-id="GN33_3">He himself went on ahead of them. He bowed toward the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_4" data-id="GN33_4">Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, hugged his neck, and kissed him. Then they wept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_5" data-id="GN33_5">When Esau looked up, he saw the women and the children. He said, "Who are these people with you?" Jacob said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_6" data-id="GN33_6">Then the female servants came forward with their children, and they bowed down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_7" data-id="GN33_7">Next Leah also and her children came forward and bowed down. Finally Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_8" data-id="GN33_8">Esau said, "What do you mean by all these groups that I met?" Jacob said, "To find favor in the sight of my master."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_9" data-id="GN33_9">Esau said, "I have enough, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_10" data-id="GN33_10">Jacob said, "No, please, if I have found favor in your eyes, then accept my gift from my hand, for indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_11" data-id="GN33_11">Please accept my gift that was brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." Thus Jacob urged him, and Esau accepted it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_12" data-id="GN33_12">Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way. I will go before you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_13" data-id="GN33_13">Jacob said to him, "My master knows that the children are young, and that the sheep and the cattle are nursing their young. If they are driven hard even one day, all the animals will die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_14" data-id="GN33_14">Please let my master go on ahead of his servant. I will travel more slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are before me, and at the pace of the children, until I come to my master in Seir."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_15" data-id="GN33_15">Esau said, "Let me leave with you some of my men who are with me." But Jacob said, "Why do that? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_16" data-id="GN33_16">So Esau that day started on his way back to Seir.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_17" data-id="GN33_17">Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_19" data-id="GN33_19">Then he bought the piece of ground where he had pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_20" data-id="GN33_20">There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.</span>
