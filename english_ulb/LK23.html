<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_1" data-id="LK23_1">The whole company of them rose up and brought Jesus before Pilate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_2" data-id="LK23_2">They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_3" data-id="LK23_3">Pilate asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered him and said, "You say so."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_4" data-id="LK23_4">Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no fault in this man."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_5" data-id="LK23_5">But they were insisting, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_6" data-id="LK23_6">So when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_7" data-id="LK23_7">When he discovered that he was under Herod's authority, he sent Jesus to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_8" data-id="LK23_8">When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, because he had wanted to see him for a long time. He had heard about him and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_9" data-id="LK23_9">Herod questioned Jesus in many words, but Jesus answered him nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_10" data-id="LK23_10">The chief priests and the scribes stood, violently accusing him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_11" data-id="LK23_11">Herod with his soldiers insulted Jesus and they mocked him. Then they dressed him in elegant clothes and sent him back to Pilate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_12" data-id="LK23_12">For Herod and Pilate had become friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been enemies with each other.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_13" data-id="LK23_13">Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the crowd of people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_14" data-id="LK23_14">and said to them, "You brought to me this man like a man who is leading the people to act badly, and see, I, having questioned him before you, find no fault in this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_15" data-id="LK23_15">No, nor does Herod, for he sent him back to us, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_16" data-id="LK23_16">I will therefore punish him, and release him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_17" data-id="LK23_17"> <span class="note" id="footnote-261"><a href="#note-261" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_18" data-id="LK23_18">But they cried out all together, saying, "Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_19" data-id="LK23_19">Barabbas was a man who had been put into prison for a certain rebellion in the city and for murder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_20" data-id="LK23_20">Pilate addressed them again, desiring to release Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_21" data-id="LK23_21">But they shouted, saying, "Crucify him, crucify him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_22" data-id="LK23_22">He said to them a third time, "Why, what evil has this man done? I have found nothing deserving the death penalty in him. Therefore after punishing him, I will release him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_23" data-id="LK23_23">But they were insistent with loud voices, demanding for him to be crucified. Their voices convinced Pilate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_24" data-id="LK23_24">So Pilate decided to grant their demand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_25" data-id="LK23_25">He released the one they asked for who had been put in prison for rioting and murder. But he delivered up Jesus to their will.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_26" data-id="LK23_26">As they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him to carry, following Jesus.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_27" data-id="LK23_27">A great crowd of the people, and of women who grieved and mourned for him, were following him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_28" data-id="LK23_28">But turning to them, Jesus said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_29" data-id="LK23_29">For see, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that did not bear, and the breasts that did not nurse.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_30" data-id="LK23_30">Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_31" data-id="LK23_31">For if they do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_32" data-id="LK23_32">Other men, two criminals, were led away with him to be put to death.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_33" data-id="LK23_33">When they came to the place that is called "The Skull," there they crucified him, and the criminals—one on his right and one on his left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_34" data-id="LK23_34">Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." Then they cast lots, dividing up his garments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_35" data-id="LK23_35">The people stood watching while the rulers also were mocking him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, the chosen one."</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_36" data-id="LK23_36">The soldiers also ridiculed him, approaching him, offering him vinegar,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_37" data-id="LK23_37">and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_38" data-id="LK23_38">There was also a sign over him, "This is the King of the Jews."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_39" data-id="LK23_39">One of the criminals who was hanging there insulted him by saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_40" data-id="LK23_40">But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_41" data-id="LK23_41">We indeed are here justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds. But this man did nothing wrong."</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_42" data-id="LK23_42">Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_43" data-id="LK23_43">Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise."</span>

<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_45" data-id="LK23_45">as the sun's light failed. Then the curtain of the temple was split in two.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_46" data-id="LK23_46">Crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." Having said this, he died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_47" data-id="LK23_47">When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, "Surely this was a righteous man."</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_48" data-id="LK23_48">When all the multitudes who came together to witness this sight saw the things that were done, they returned beating their breasts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_49" data-id="LK23_49">But all those who knew him, and the women who followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</span>
