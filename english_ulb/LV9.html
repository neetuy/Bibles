<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_2" data-id="LV9_2">He said to Aaron, "Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram without blemish for a burnt offering, and offer them before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_3" data-id="LV9_3">You must speak to the people of Israel and say, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb, both a year old and without blemish, for a burnt offering;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_4" data-id="LV9_4">also take an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before Yahweh, and a grain offering mixed with oil, because today Yahweh will appear to you.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_5" data-id="LV9_5">So they brought all that Moses commanded to the tent of meeting, and all the assembly of Israel approached and stood before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_6" data-id="LV9_6">Then Moses said, "This is what Yahweh commanded you to do, so that his glory may appear to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_7" data-id="LV9_7">Moses said to Aaron, "Come near the altar and offer your sin offering and burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people, and offer the sacrifice for the people to make atonement for them, as Yahweh has commanded."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_8" data-id="LV9_8">So Aaron went near the altar and killed the calf for the sin offering, which was for himself.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_13" data-id="LV9_13">Then they gave him the burnt offering, piece by piece, together with the head, and he burned them on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_14" data-id="LV9_14">He washed the inner parts and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_18" data-id="LV9_18">He killed also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice for the peace offering, which was for the people. Aaron's sons gave him the blood, which he sprinkled against every side of the altar.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_20" data-id="LV9_20">They took the parts that were cut out and put these on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_21" data-id="LV9_21">Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses had commanded.</span>
