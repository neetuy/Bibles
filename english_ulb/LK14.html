<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_1" data-id="LK14_1">It happened one Sabbath, when he went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees to eat bread, that they were watching him closely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_2" data-id="LK14_2">Behold, there in front of him was a man who was suffering from edema.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_3" data-id="LK14_3">Jesus asked the experts in the Jewish law and the Pharisees, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_4" data-id="LK14_4">But they kept silent. So Jesus took hold of him, healed him, and sent him away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_5" data-id="LK14_5">He said to them, "Which of you who has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day will not immediately pull him out?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_6" data-id="LK14_6">They were not able to give an answer to these things.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_7" data-id="LK14_7">When Jesus noticed how those who were invited chose the seats of honor, he spoke a parable, saying to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_8" data-id="LK14_8">"When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the place of honor, because someone may have been invited who is more honored than you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_9" data-id="LK14_9">When the person who invited both of you arrives, he will say to you, 'Give this other person your place,' and then in shame you will proceed to take the lowest place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_10" data-id="LK14_10">But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, 'Friend, go up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_11" data-id="LK14_11">For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_12" data-id="LK14_12">Jesus also said to the man who had invited him, "When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors, as they may also invite you in return, and you will be repaid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_13" data-id="LK14_13">But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_14" data-id="LK14_14">and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the just."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_15" data-id="LK14_15">When one of them who sat at the table with Jesus heard these things, he said to him, "Blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_16" data-id="LK14_16">But Jesus said to him, "A certain man prepared a large dinner and invited many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_17" data-id="LK14_17">When the dinner was prepared, he sent his servant to say to those who were invited, 'Come, because everything is now ready.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_18" data-id="LK14_18">They all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please excuse me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_19" data-id="LK14_19">Another said, 'I have bought five pairs of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please excuse me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_20" data-id="LK14_20">Then another man said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_21" data-id="LK14_21">The servant came and told his master these things. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in here the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_22" data-id="LK14_22">The servant said, 'Master, what you commanded has been done, and yet there is still room.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_23" data-id="LK14_23">The master said to the servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_24" data-id="LK14_24">For I say to you, none of those men who were invited will taste my dinner.'"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_25" data-id="LK14_25">Now large crowds were going with him, and he turned and said to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_26" data-id="LK14_26">"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_27" data-id="LK14_27">Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_28" data-id="LK14_28">For which of you who desires to build a tower does not first sit down and count the cost to calculate if he has what he needs to complete it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_29" data-id="LK14_29">Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to mock him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_30" data-id="LK14_30">saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_31" data-id="LK14_31">Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take advice about whether he is able with ten thousand men to fight the other king who comes against him with twenty thousand men?</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_32" data-id="LK14_32">If not, while the other army is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for conditions of peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_33" data-id="LK14_33">So therefore, any one of you who does not give up all that he has cannot be my disciple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_34" data-id="LK14_34">Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK14_35" data-id="LK14_35">It is of no use for the soil or even for the manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</span>
