<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_8" data-id="J14_8">The person who does not love does not know God, for God is love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_9" data-id="J14_9">Because of this the love of God was revealed among us, that God has sent his only Son into the world so that we would live because of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_10" data-id="J14_10">In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and that he sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_13" data-id="J14_13">By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us some of his Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_14" data-id="J14_14">Also, we have seen and have borne witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_16" data-id="J14_16">Also, we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and the one who remains in this love remains in God, and God remains in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_17" data-id="J14_17">Because of this, this love has been made perfect among us, so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because as he is, just so are we in this world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_18" data-id="J14_18">There is no fear in love. Instead, perfect love throws out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. But the one who fears has not been made perfect in love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_19" data-id="J14_19">We love because God first loved us.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_21" data-id="J14_21">Also, this is the commandment we have from him: Whoever loves God must also love his own brother.</span>
