<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_1" data-id="JM5_1">Come now, you who are rich, weep and wail because of the miseries coming on you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_2" data-id="JM5_2">Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_3" data-id="JM5_3">Your gold and your silver have become tarnished and their rust will be a witness against you. It will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up your treasure for the last days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_4" data-id="JM5_4">Look, the pay of the laborers is crying outâ€”the pay that you have withheld from those who harvested your fields, and the cries of the harvesters have gone into the ears of the Lord of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_5" data-id="JM5_5">You have lived in luxury on the earth and indulged yourselves. You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_6" data-id="JM5_6">You have condemned and killed the righteous person. He does not resist you.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_7" data-id="JM5_7">So be patient, brothers, until the Lord's coming. See, the farmer awaits the valuable harvest from the ground. He is patiently waiting for it, until it receives the early and late rains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_8" data-id="JM5_8">You, too, be patient. Make your hearts strong, because the Lord's coming is near.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_9" data-id="JM5_9">Do not complain, brothers, against one another, so that you will be not judged. See, the judge is standing at the door.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_10" data-id="JM5_10">Take an example, brothers, from the suffering and patience of the prophets, those who spoke in the name of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_11" data-id="JM5_11">See, we regard those who endured as blessed. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you know the purpose of the Lord, how he is very compassionate and merciful.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_12" data-id="JM5_12">Above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by the earth, or by any other oath. Instead, let your "Yes" mean "Yes" and your "No" mean "No," so you do not fall under judgment.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_13" data-id="JM5_13">Is anyone among you suffering hardship? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_14" data-id="JM5_14">Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him. Let them anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_15" data-id="JM5_15">The prayer of faith will heal the sick person, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, God will forgive him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_16" data-id="JM5_16">So confess your sins to one another, and pray for each other, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is very strong in its working.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_17" data-id="JM5_17">Elijah was a man just like us. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain in the land for three years and six months.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_18" data-id="JM5_18">Then Elijah prayed again. The heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_19" data-id="JM5_19">My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone brings him back,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_20" data-id="JM5_20">that person should know that whoever turns a sinner from his wandering way will save him from death, and will cover over a great number of sins. </span>
