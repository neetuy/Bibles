<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_17" data-id="S117_17">Then Jesse said to his son David, "Take to your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp for your brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_18" data-id="S117_18">Also bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand. See how your brothers are doing and bring back some proof that they are doing well.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_23" data-id="S117_23">As he talked with them, the strong man, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, and he came out of the ranks of the Philistines, and said the same words as before, and David heard them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_24" data-id="S117_24">When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him and were very afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_25" data-id="S117_25">The men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who has come up? He has come to challenge Israel. The king will give great riches to the man who kills him, and he will give his daughter to him in marriage, and will make his father's house free from taxation in Israel."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_26" data-id="S117_26">David said to the men who stood by him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_27" data-id="S117_27">Then the people repeated what they had been saying and told him, "So it will be done for the man who kills him."</span>

<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_28" data-id="S117_28">Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, "Why did you come down here? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the mischief in your heart; for you have come down here so that you might see the battle."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_29" data-id="S117_29">David said, "What have I done now? Was it not just a question?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_30" data-id="S117_30">He turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way. The people answered the same thing as before.</span>

<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_31" data-id="S117_31">When the words that David said were heard, soldiers repeated them to Saul, and he sent for David.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_32" data-id="S117_32">Then David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail because of that Philistine; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_33" data-id="S117_33">Saul said to David, "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are only a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_34" data-id="S117_34">But David said to Saul, "Your servant used to keep his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_35" data-id="S117_35">I chased after him and attacked him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he rose up against me, I caught him by his beard, struck him, and killed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_36" data-id="S117_36">Your servant has killed both a lion and a bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has challenged the armies of the living God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_37" data-id="S117_37">David said, "Yahweh rescued me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear. He will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine." Then Saul said to David, "Go, and may Yahweh be with you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_38" data-id="S117_38">Saul clothed David with his armor. He put a helmet of bronze upon his head, and he clothed him with a coat of chainmail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_39" data-id="S117_39">David strapped his sword on his armor. But he was not able to walk, because he had not trained with them. Then David said to Saul, "I cannot go out to fight with these, for I have not trained with them." So David put them off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_40" data-id="S117_40">He took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones out of the brook; he put them in his shepherd's pouch. His sling was in his hand as he approached the Philistine.</span>

<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_41" data-id="S117_41">The Philistine came and approached David, with his shield bearer in front of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_42" data-id="S117_42">When the Philistine looked around and saw David, he despised him, for he was only a boy, and ruddy, with a handsome appearance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_43" data-id="S117_43">Then the Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?," and the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_44" data-id="S117_44">The Philistine said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field."</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_45" data-id="S117_45">David replied to the Philistine, "You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin.

<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_46" data-id="S117_46">Today Yahweh will give me victory over you, and I will kill you and remove your head from your body. Today I will give the dead bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_47" data-id="S117_47">and that all this gathering may know that Yahweh does not give victory with sword or spear. For the battle is Yahweh's, and he will give you into our hand."</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_48" data-id="S117_48">When the Philistine rose and approached David, then David ran quickly toward the enemy army to meet him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_49" data-id="S117_49">David put his hand in his bag, took a stone from it, slung it, and hit the Philistine in the forehead. The stone sank into the Philistine's forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_50" data-id="S117_50">David defeated the Philistine with a sling and with a stone. He hit the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in David's hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_51" data-id="S117_51">Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword, drew it out of the sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their strong man was dead, they fled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_52" data-id="S117_52">Then the men of Israel and of Judah rose with a shout, and chased after the Philistines as far as the valley and the gates of Ekron. The dead Philistines lay along the way to Shaaraim, all the way to Gath and Ekron.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_53" data-id="S117_53">The people of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.</span>
