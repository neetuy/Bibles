<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_2" data-id="LK18_2">saying, "In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and did not respect people.</span>

<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_4" data-id="LK18_4">For a long time he was not willing to help her, but after a while he said to himself, 'Though I do not fear God or respect man,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_5" data-id="LK18_5">yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will help her get justice, so that she does not wear me out by her constant coming.'"</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_10" data-id="LK18_10">"Two men went up into the temple to pray—the one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_11" data-id="LK18_11">The Pharisee stood and prayed these things about himself, 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, unrighteous people, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_19" data-id="LK18_19">Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good, except God alone.</span>

<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_24" data-id="LK18_24">Then Jesus, seeing him, became very sad <span class="note" id="footnote-260"><a href="#note-260" class="key">†</a></span> and said, "How difficult it is for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God!</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_25" data-id="LK18_25">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."</span>

<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_36" data-id="LK18_36">and hearing a crowd going by, he asked what was happening.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_37" data-id="LK18_37">They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_38" data-id="LK18_38">So the blind man cried out, saying, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_39" data-id="LK18_39">The ones who were walking ahead rebuked the blind man, telling him to be quiet. But he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_40" data-id="LK18_40">Jesus stood still and commanded that the man be brought to him. Then when the blind man was near, Jesus asked him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_41" data-id="LK18_41">"What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "Lord, I want to receive my sight."</span>
