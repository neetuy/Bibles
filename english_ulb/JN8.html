<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_2" data-id="JN8_2">Early in the morning he came to the temple again, and all the people came; he sat down and taught them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_3" data-id="JN8_3">The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in the act of adultery. They placed her in the middle.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_5" data-id="JN8_5">Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such people; what do you say about her?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_6" data-id="JN8_6">They said this in order to trap him so that they might have something to accuse him about, but Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_7" data-id="JN8_7"> <span class="note" id="footnote-268"><a href="#note-268" class="key">†</a></span> When they continued asking him questions, he stood up and said to them, "The one among you who has no sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_8" data-id="JN8_8">Again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_10" data-id="JN8_10">Jesus stood up and said to her, "Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?"</span>

<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_12" data-id="JN8_12">Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in the darkness but will have the light of life."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_13" data-id="JN8_13">The Pharisees said to him, "You bear witness about yourself; your witness is not true."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_14" data-id="JN8_14">Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I bear witness about myself, my witness is true. I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I came from or where I am going.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_15" data-id="JN8_15">You judge according the flesh; I judge no one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_16" data-id="JN8_16">Yet if I judge, my judgment is true because I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_17" data-id="JN8_17">Yes, and in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_18" data-id="JN8_18">I am he who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me."</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_20" data-id="JN8_20">He said these words in the treasury as he taught in the temple, and no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_21" data-id="JN8_21">So again he said to them, "I am going away; you will seek me and will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_22" data-id="JN8_22">The Jews said, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I am going you cannot come'?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_23" data-id="JN8_23">Jesus said to them, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_25" data-id="JN8_25">They said therefore to him, "Who are you?" Jesus said to them, "What I have said to you from the beginning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_26" data-id="JN8_26">I have many things to speak and to judge about you. However, he who sent me is true; and the things that I heard from him, these things I say to the world."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_27" data-id="JN8_27">They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_28" data-id="JN8_28">Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then will you know that I AM, and that I do nothing of myself. As the Father taught me, I speak these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_29" data-id="JN8_29">He who sent me is with me, and he has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_31" data-id="JN8_31">Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him, "If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_32" data-id="JN8_32">and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_33" data-id="JN8_33">They answered him, "We are descendants of Abraham and have never been slaves of anyone; how can you say, 'You will be set free'?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_34" data-id="JN8_34">Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_35" data-id="JN8_35">The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_36" data-id="JN8_36">Therefore, if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_37" data-id="JN8_37">I know that you are Abraham's descendants; you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_38" data-id="JN8_38">I say what I have seen with my Father, and you also do what you heard from your father."</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_39" data-id="JN8_39">They answered and said to him, "Our father is Abraham." Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_40" data-id="JN8_40">Yet, now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_41" data-id="JN8_41">You do the works of your father." They said to him, "We were not born in sexual immorality; we have one Father: God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_42" data-id="JN8_42">Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and am here; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_43" data-id="JN8_43">Why do you not understand my words? It is because you cannot hear my words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_44" data-id="JN8_44">You are of your father, the devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature because he is a liar and the father of lies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_45" data-id="JN8_45">Yet, because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_46" data-id="JN8_46">Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_47" data-id="JN8_47">He who is of God hears the words of God; you do not hear them because you are not of God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_48" data-id="JN8_48">The Jews answered and said to him, "Do we not truly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_49" data-id="JN8_49">Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_50" data-id="JN8_50">I do not seek my glory; there is one seeking and judging.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_51" data-id="JN8_51">Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_52" data-id="JN8_52">The Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets died; but you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_53" data-id="JN8_53">You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who do you make yourself out to be?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-54 " data-id="bibleJsn">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_54" data-id="JN8_54">Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me—about whom you say that he is your God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55 " data-id="bibleJsn">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_55" data-id="JN8_55">You have not known him, but I know him. If I would say, 'I do not know him,' I would be like you, a liar. However, I know him and keep his word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56 " data-id="bibleJsn">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_56" data-id="JN8_56">Your father Abraham rejoiced at seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."</span>
<span class="v-num v-57 " data-id="bibleJsn">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_57" data-id="JN8_57">The Jews said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-58 " data-id="bibleJsn">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_58" data-id="JN8_58">Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM."</span>
<span class="v-num v-59 " data-id="bibleJsn">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_59" data-id="JN8_59">Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.</span>
