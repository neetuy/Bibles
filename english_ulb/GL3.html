<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_1" data-id="GL3_1">Foolish Galatians! Who has put a spell on you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly displayed as crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_2" data-id="GL3_2">This is the only thing I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing what you heard?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_3" data-id="GL3_3">Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now going to finish by the flesh?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_4" data-id="GL3_4">Have you suffered so many things for nothing—if indeed it was for nothing?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_5" data-id="GL3_5">Does he who gives the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by the works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_6" data-id="GL3_6">Just as Abraham "believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness,"</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_7" data-id="GL3_7">in the same way, understand, then, that those of faith are the children of Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_8" data-id="GL3_8">The scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you all the nations will be blessed."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_9" data-id="GL3_9">So then, those of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_10" data-id="GL3_10">All who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; and so it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the book of the law, and do them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_11" data-id="GL3_11">Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because "the righteous will live by faith."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_12" data-id="GL3_12">But the law is not of faith, rather, "The person who does the works of the law must live by them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_13" data-id="GL3_13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree"—</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_14" data-id="GL3_14">so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_15" data-id="GL3_15">Brothers, let me speak in human terms. In a man-made contract, no one can set it aside or add to it, once it is established by law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_16" data-id="GL3_16">Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. It does not say, "to descendants," referring to many, but instead to only one, "and to your descendant," who is Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_17" data-id="GL3_17">Now what I mean is this: The law, which came 430 years afterward, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_18" data-id="GL3_18">For if the inheritance comes by the law, then it no longer comes by promise. But God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_19" data-id="GL3_19">What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of trespasses, until the descendant of Abraham would come to whom the promise had been made. The law was put into force through angels by a mediator.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_20" data-id="GL3_20">Now a mediator implies more than one person, but God is one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_21" data-id="GL3_21">So is the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_22" data-id="GL3_22">But the scripture imprisoned everything under sin. God did this so that the promise to save us by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_23" data-id="GL3_23">Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until faith should be revealed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_24" data-id="GL3_24">So then the law became our guardian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_25" data-id="GL3_25">But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_26" data-id="GL3_26">For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_27" data-id="GL3_27">For as many of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_28" data-id="GL3_28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_29" data-id="GL3_29">Then if you are Christ's, you are Abraham's descendants, and heirs according to promise.</span>
