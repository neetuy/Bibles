<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_1" data-id="EP3_1">Because of this I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_2" data-id="EP3_2">I assume that you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God that was given to me for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_3" data-id="EP3_3">I am writing according to the revelation made known to me. This is the hidden truth about which I briefly wrote to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_4" data-id="EP3_4">When you read about this, you will be able to understand my insight into this hidden truth about Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_5" data-id="EP3_5">In other generations this truth was not made known to the sons of men. But now it has been revealed by the Spirit to his apostles and prophets who were set apart for this work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_6" data-id="EP3_6">This hidden truth is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and they share the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_7" data-id="EP3_7">For I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given to me through the working of his power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_8" data-id="EP3_8">To me—although I am the least of all the saints—this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_9" data-id="EP3_9">so that I will bring to light for everyone the plan—the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_10" data-id="EP3_10">This plan was made known through the church so the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places would come to know the many-sided nature of the wisdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_11" data-id="EP3_11">This happened according to the eternal plan that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_12" data-id="EP3_12">For in Christ we have boldness and access with confidence because of our faith in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_13" data-id="EP3_13">Therefore I ask you not to be discouraged because of what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_14" data-id="EP3_14">For this reason I bend my knees to the Father,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_15" data-id="EP3_15">from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_16" data-id="EP3_16">I pray that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power through his Spirit, who is in you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_17" data-id="EP3_17">I pray that Christ may live in your hearts through faith, that you will be rooted and grounded in his love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_18" data-id="EP3_18">May you have strength so you can understand, along with all the believers, what is the width, the length, the height, and the depth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_19" data-id="EP3_19">and that you may know the love of Christ, which goes beyond knowledge, and that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_20" data-id="EP3_20">Now to him who is able to do far beyond all that we ask or think, according to his power that works in us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_21" data-id="EP3_21">to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.</span>
