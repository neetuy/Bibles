<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_1" data-id="RM10_1">Brothers, my heart's desire and my request to God is for them, for their salvation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_2" data-id="RM10_2">For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_3" data-id="RM10_3">For they do not know of God's righteousness, and they seek to establish their own righteousness. They did not submit to the righteousness of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_4" data-id="RM10_4">For Christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness for everyone who believes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_5" data-id="RM10_5">For Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the law: "The man who does the righteousness of the law will live by this righteousness."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_6" data-id="RM10_6">But the righteousness that comes from faith says this, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down);</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_7" data-id="RM10_7">and do not say, 'Who will descend into the abyss?'" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_8" data-id="RM10_8">But what does it say?</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_8" data-id="RM10_8">"The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v RM10_8" data-id="RM10_8">That is the word of faith, which we proclaim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_9" data-id="RM10_9">For if with your mouth you acknowledge Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_10" data-id="RM10_10">For with the heart man believes for righteousness, and with the mouth he acknowledges for salvation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_11" data-id="RM10_11">For scripture says, "Everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_12" data-id="RM10_12">For there is no difference between Jew and Greek. For the same Lord is Lord of all, and he is rich to all who call upon him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_13" data-id="RM10_13">For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_14" data-id="RM10_14">How then can they call on him in whom they have not believed? How can they believe in him of whom they have not heard? How can they hear without a preacher?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_15" data-id="RM10_15">Then how can they preach, unless they are sent?â€”As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim good news!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_16" data-id="RM10_16">But not all of them obeyed the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_17" data-id="RM10_17">So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_18" data-id="RM10_18">But I say, "Did they not hear?" Yes, most certainly.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_18" data-id="RM10_18">"Their sound has gone out into all the earth,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_18" data-id="RM10_18">and their words to the ends of the world."</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_19" data-id="RM10_19">Moreover, I say, "Did Israel not know?" First Moses says,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_19" data-id="RM10_19">"I will provoke you to jealousy by what is not a nation.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_19" data-id="RM10_19">By means of a nation without understanding, I will stir you up to anger."</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_20" data-id="RM10_20">Then Isaiah was very bold when he says,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_20" data-id="RM10_20">"I was found by those who did not seek me.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_20" data-id="RM10_20">I appeared to those who did not ask for me."</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_21" data-id="RM10_21">But to Israel he says, "All the day long I reached out my hands to a disobedient and stubborn people."</span>
