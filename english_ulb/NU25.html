<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU25_2" data-id="NU25_2">for the Moabites had invited the people to the sacrifices to their gods. So the people ate and bowed down to Moabite gods.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU25_6" data-id="NU25_6">Then one of the men of Israel came and brought among his family members a Midianite woman. This happened in the sight of Moses and all the community of the people of Israel, while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU25_7" data-id="NU25_7">When Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, saw that, he rose up from among the community and took a spear in his hand.</span>
