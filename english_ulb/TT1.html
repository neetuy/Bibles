<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_6" data-id="TT1_6">An elder must be without blame, the husband of one wife, with faithful children not accused of reckless behavior or undisciplined.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_7" data-id="TT1_7">It is necessary for the overseer, as God's household manager, to be blameless. He must not be arrogant, not be easily angered, not addicted to wine, not a brawler, and not a greedy man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_8" data-id="TT1_8">Instead, he should be hospitable and a friend of what is good. He must be sensible, righteous, godly, and self-controlled.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_11" data-id="TT1_11">It is necessary to stop them. They are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful profit what they should not teach.</span>
