<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_1" data-id="C15_1">We heard a report that there is sexual immorality among you, a kind of immorality that is not even permitted among the Gentiles: A man has his father's wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_2" data-id="C15_2">You are so arrogant! Should you not mourn instead? The one who did this must be removed from among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_3" data-id="C15_3">For even though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit. I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as though I were there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_4" data-id="C15_4">When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_5" data-id="C15_5">hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_6" data-id="C15_6">Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole loaf?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_7" data-id="C15_7">Cleanse yourselves of the old yeast so that you may be new dough, so that you may be unleavened bread. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_8" data-id="C15_8">So let us then celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of bad behavior and wickedness. Instead, let us celebrate with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_9" data-id="C15_9">I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_10" data-id="C15_10">In no way did I mean the immoral people of this world, or the greedy, or swindlers, or idolaters, since to stay away from them you would need to go out of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_11" data-id="C15_11">But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother but who is living in sexual immorality, or who is greedy, or is an idolater, or is verbally abusive, or is a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat a meal with such a person.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_12" data-id="C15_12">For how am I involved with judging those who are outside the church? Instead, are you not to judge those who are inside the church?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_13" data-id="C15_13">But God judges those who are on the outside.</span>
