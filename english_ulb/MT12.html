<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_2" data-id="MT12_2">But when the Pharisees saw that, they said to Jesus, "See, your disciples do what is unlawful to do on the Sabbath."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_3" data-id="MT12_3">But Jesus said to them, "Have you never read what David did, when he was hungry, and the men who were with him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_4" data-id="MT12_4">He went into the house of God and ate the bread of the presence, which was unlawful for him to eat and unlawful for those who were with him, but lawful only for the priests.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_5" data-id="MT12_5">Have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath but are guiltless?</span>
