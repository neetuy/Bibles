<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_1" data-id="JR41_1">But it happened that in the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, from the royal family, and some officers of the king, came—ten men were with him—to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. They ate food together there in Mizpah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_2" data-id="JR41_2">But Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him rose up and attacked Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, with the sword. Ishmael killed Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon had put in charge of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_3" data-id="JR41_3">Then Ishmael killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah in Mizpah and the Chaldean fighting men found there.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_4" data-id="JR41_4">Then it was the second day after the killing of Gedaliah, but no one knew.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_5" data-id="JR41_5">Some men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria—eighty men who had shaved their beard, torn their clothes, and cut themselves—with food offerings and frankincense in their hands to go to Yahweh's house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_6" data-id="JR41_6">So Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them as they went, walking and weeping. Then it happened that as he encountered them, he said to them, "Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_7" data-id="JR41_7">It came about that when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah slaughtered them and threw them into a pit, he and the men who were with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_8" data-id="JR41_8">But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, "Do not kill us, for there are provisions of ours in a field: Wheat and barley, oil and honey." So he did not kill them with their other companions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_9" data-id="JR41_9">The cistern where Ishmael threw all the dead bodies that he had killed, was a large cistern that King Asa dug to make a defense against King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it in with the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_10" data-id="JR41_10">Next Ishmael captured all the other people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah whom Nebuzaradan the chief guard had assigned to Gedaliah son of Ahikam. So Ishmael son of Nethaniah captured them and went to cross over to the people of Ammon.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_11" data-id="JR41_11">But Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders with him heard of all the harm that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_12" data-id="JR41_12">So they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They found him at the great pool of Gibeon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_13" data-id="JR41_13">Then it happened that when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders who were with him, they were very happy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_14" data-id="JR41_14">So all the people whom Ishmael had captured at Mizpah turned around and went to Johanan son of Kareah.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_15" data-id="JR41_15">But Ishmael son of Nethaniah fled with eight men from Johanan. He went to the people of Ammon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR41_16" data-id="JR41_16">Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders with him took from Mizpah all the people who had been rescued from Ishmael son of Nethaniah.
