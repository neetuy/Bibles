<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_1" data-id="JN15_1">"I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_2" data-id="JN15_2">He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit, and he prunes every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_3" data-id="JN15_3">You are already clean because of the message that I have spoken to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_4" data-id="JN15_4">Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_5" data-id="JN15_5">I am the vine, you are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for without me you can do nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_6" data-id="JN15_6">If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown away like a branch and dries up, and they gather the branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burned up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_7" data-id="JN15_7">If you remain in me, and if my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_8" data-id="JN15_8">My Father is glorified in this, that you bear much fruit and so prove that you are my disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_9" data-id="JN15_9">As the Father has loved me, I have also loved you. Remain in my love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_10" data-id="JN15_10">If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, as I have kept the commandments of my Father and remain in his love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_11" data-id="JN15_11">I have spoken these things to you so that my joy will be in you and so that your joy will be complete.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_12" data-id="JN15_12">This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_13" data-id="JN15_13">No one has greater love than this—that he lay down his life for his friends.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_14" data-id="JN15_14">You are my friends if you do the things that I command you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_15" data-id="JN15_15">No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_16" data-id="JN15_16">You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain. This is so that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_17" data-id="JN15_17">These things I command you, so that you love one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_18" data-id="JN15_18">If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_19" data-id="JN15_19">If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. But because you are not of the world and because I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_20" data-id="JN15_20">Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will also keep yours.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_21" data-id="JN15_21">They will do all these things to you because of my name, because they do not know him who sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_22" data-id="JN15_22">If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_23" data-id="JN15_23">He who hates me also hates my Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_24" data-id="JN15_24">If I had not done the works that no one else did among them, they would have no sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_25" data-id="JN15_25">But this is in order to fulfill the word that is written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_26" data-id="JN15_26">When the Comforter—whom I will send to you from the Father, that is, the Spirit of truth, who goes out from the Father—comes, he will testify about me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_27" data-id="JN15_27">You are also testifying because you have been with me from the beginning.</span>
