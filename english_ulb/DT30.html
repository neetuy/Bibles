<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_2" data-id="DT30_2">and when you return to Yahweh your God and obey his voice, following all that I am commanding you today— you and your children—with all your heart and with all your soul,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_3" data-id="DT30_3">then Yahweh your God will reverse your captivity and have compassion on you; he will return and gather you from all the peoples where Yahweh your God has scattered you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_4" data-id="DT30_4">If any of your exiled people are in the farthest places under the heavens, from there Yahweh your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_5" data-id="DT30_5">Yahweh your God will bring you into the land that your forefathers possessed, and you will possess it again; he will do you good and will multiply you more than he did your forefathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_6" data-id="DT30_6">Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, so you will love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_11" data-id="DT30_11">For this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too hard for you, neither is it too far for you to reach.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_12" data-id="DT30_12">It is not in heaven, so that you should have to say, 'Who will go up for us to heaven and bring it down to us and make us able to hear it, so that we may do it?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_13" data-id="DT30_13">Neither is it beyond the sea, so that you should have to say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us and make us to hear it, so that we may do it?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_14" data-id="DT30_14">But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and your heart, so that you may do it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_15" data-id="DT30_15">See, today I have placed before you life and good, death and evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_16" data-id="DT30_16">If you obey the decrees of Yahweh your God, in which I am commanding you today to love Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments, his regulations, and his statutes, you will live and multiply, and Yahweh your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to possess.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_17" data-id="DT30_17">But if your heart turns away, and you do not listen but instead are drawn away and bow down to other gods and worship them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_18" data-id="DT30_18">then I announce to you today that you will surely perish; you will not prolong your days in the land that you are passing over the Jordan to go into and possess.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_19" data-id="DT30_19">I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, the blessings and the curses; therefore choose life so that you may live, you and your descendants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT30_20" data-id="DT30_20">Do this so as to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him. For he is your life and the length of your days; do this so that you may live in the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them."</span>
