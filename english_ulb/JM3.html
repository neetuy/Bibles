<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_1" data-id="JM3_1">Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_2" data-id="JM3_2">For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in words, he is a perfect man, able to control even his whole body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_3" data-id="JM3_3">Now if we put bits into horses' mouths for them to obey us, we can also direct their whole bodies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_4" data-id="JM3_4">Notice also that ships, although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, are steered by a very small rudder to wherever the pilot desires.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_5" data-id="JM3_5">Likewise the tongue is a small body part, yet it boasts great things. Notice also how small a fire sets on fire a large forest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_6" data-id="JM3_6">The tongue is also a fire, a world of sinfulness set among our body parts. It stains the whole body and sets on fire the course of life. It is itself set on fire by hell.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_7" data-id="JM3_7">For every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_8" data-id="JM3_8">But no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_9" data-id="JM3_9">With it we praise the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_10" data-id="JM3_10">Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things should not happen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_11" data-id="JM3_11">Does a spring pour out from its opening both sweet and bitter water?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_12" data-id="JM3_12">Does a fig tree, my brothers, make olives? Or a grapevine, figs? Neither can salty water produce sweet water.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_13" data-id="JM3_13">Who is wise and understanding among you? Let that person show a good life by his works in the humility of wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_14" data-id="JM3_14">But if you have bitter jealousy and ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_15" data-id="JM3_15">This is not the wisdom that comes down from above. Instead, it is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_16" data-id="JM3_16">For where there are jealousy and ambition, there is confusion and every evil practice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_17" data-id="JM3_17">But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_18" data-id="JM3_18">The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace among those who make peace.</span>
