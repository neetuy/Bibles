<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_1" data-id="H23_1">Now, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may rush and be glorified, as it also is with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_2" data-id="H23_2">Pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not all have faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_3" data-id="H23_3">But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_4" data-id="H23_4">We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you both do and will continue to do the things that we command.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_5" data-id="H23_5">May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_6" data-id="H23_6">Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you avoid every brother who lives a lazy life and does not live according to the traditions you received from us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_7" data-id="H23_7">For you yourselves know it is proper for you to imitate us. We did not live among you as those who had no discipline.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_8" data-id="H23_8">We did not eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead, we worked night and day in difficult labor and hardship, so we might not be a burden to any of you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_9" data-id="H23_9">We did this not because we have no authority. Instead, we did this in order to be an example to you, so that you may imitate us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_10" data-id="H23_10">For when we were with you, we commanded you, "The one who is unwilling to work must not eat."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_11" data-id="H23_11">For we hear that some walk idly among you. They do not work but are instead meddlers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_12" data-id="H23_12">Now such ones we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they should work with quietness and eat their own food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_13" data-id="H23_13">But you, brothers, do not lose heart in doing what is right.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_14" data-id="H23_14">And if anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take note of him and have no association with him, so that he may be ashamed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_15" data-id="H23_15">Yet do not consider him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.</span>
