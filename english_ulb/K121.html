<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K121_2" data-id="K121_2">Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, "Give me your vineyard, so I can have it as a vegetable garden, because it is near my house. In exchange, I will give you a better vineyard, or, if you prefer, I will pay you its value in money."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K121_3" data-id="K121_3">Naboth replied to Ahab, "May Yahweh forbid that I should give the inheritance of my ancestors to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K121_4" data-id="K121_4">So Ahab went into his palace resentful and angry because of the answer Naboth the Jezreelite gave him when he said, "I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors." He lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and refused to eat any food.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K121_7" data-id="K121_7">So Jezebel his wife replied to him, "Do you not still rule the kingdom of Israel? Get up and eat; let your heart be happy. I will obtain for you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K121_8" data-id="K121_8">So Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab's name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and to the wealthy who sat with him in meetings, and who lived near Naboth.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K121_15" data-id="K121_15">So when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, she said to Ahab, "Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money, because Naboth is not alive, but dead."</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K121_21" data-id="K121_21">Yahweh says this to you: 'See, I will bring disaster on you and will completely consume and cut off from you every male child and slave and free man in Israel.</span>
