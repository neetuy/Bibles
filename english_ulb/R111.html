<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_1" data-id="R111_1">Then all Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Look, we are your flesh and bone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_2" data-id="R111_2">In the recent past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led the Israelite army. Yahweh your God said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become a ruler over my people Israel.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_3" data-id="R111_3">So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them before Yahweh. They anointed David king over Israel. In this way, the word of Yahweh that had been declared by Samuel came true.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_4" data-id="R111_4">David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). Now the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_5" data-id="R111_5">The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You will not come in here." But David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_6" data-id="R111_6">David had said, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become chief and commander." So Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first, so he was made the chief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_7" data-id="R111_7">Then David began to live in the stronghold. So they called it the city of David.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_8" data-id="R111_8">He built the city all around from the Millo and back to the surrounding wall. Joab restored the rest of the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_9" data-id="R111_9">David became greater and greater because Yahweh of hosts was with him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_10" data-id="R111_10">These were the leaders David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, obeying the word of Yahweh concerning Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_11" data-id="R111_11">This is a list of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, was commander of the officers <span class="note" id="footnote-45"><a href="#note-45" class="key">â€ </a></span>. He killed three hundred men with his spear on one occasion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_12" data-id="R111_12">After him was Eleazar son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_13" data-id="R111_13">He was with David at Pas Dammim, and there the Philistines assembled together for battle, where there was a barley field and the army fled from the Philistines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_14" data-id="R111_14">They stood in the middle of the field. They defended it and cut down the Philistines and Yahweh rescued them with a great victory.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_15" data-id="R111_15">Then three of the thirty leaders went down to the rock to David, to the cave of Adullam. The army of the Philistines was camped in the Valley of Rephaim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_16" data-id="R111_16">At that time David was in his stronghold, a cave, while the Philistines had established their camp at Bethlehem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_17" data-id="R111_17">David was longing for water and said, "If only someone would give me water to drink from the well at Bethlehem, the well that is by the gate!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_18" data-id="R111_18">So these three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate. They took the water and brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_19" data-id="R111_19">Then he said, "May it be that I should never do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who have risked their lives?" Because they had put their lives at risk, David refused to drink it. These were the deeds of the three mighty men.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_20" data-id="R111_20">Abishai brother of Joab was captain over the Three. He once used his spear against three hundred and killed them. He is mentioned along with the Three.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_21" data-id="R111_21">Of the Three, he was given double honor and became their captain, even though he was not one of them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_22" data-id="R111_22">Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave warrior from Kabzeel, who did great deeds. He killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down into a pit and killed a lion on a day when the snow was falling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_23" data-id="R111_23">He even killed an Egyptian, a man five cubits tall. The Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's beam, but he went down to him with only a staff. He seized the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_24" data-id="R111_24">Benaiah son of Jehoiada did these feats, and he was named alongside the three mighty men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R111_25" data-id="R111_25">He was more highly regarded than the thirty soldiers in general, but he was not regarded quite as highly as the three mighty men. Yet David put him in charge of his bodyguard.</span>
