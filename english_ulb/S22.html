<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S22_17" data-id="S22_17">The battle was very severe that day and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated before the servants of David.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S22_21" data-id="S22_21">Abner said to him, "Turn aside to your right or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his armor." But Asahel would not turn aside.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S22_22" data-id="S22_22">So Abner said again to Asahel, "Stop pursuing me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I hold up my face to Joab, your brother?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S22_23" data-id="S22_23">But Asahel refused to turn aside, and so Abner stabbed him in the body with the blunt end of his spear, so that the spear came out the other side. Asahel fell down and died there. So it came about that anyone who arrived at the place where Asahel fell down and died, he stopped and stood still.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S22_24" data-id="S22_24">But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. When the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is near Giah by the road to the wilderness of Gibeon.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S22_26" data-id="S22_26">Then Abner called to Joab and said, "Must the sword devour forever? Do you not know it will be bitter in the end? How long will it be before you tell your men to stop pursuing their brothers?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S22_27" data-id="S22_27">Joab replied, "Just as God lives, if you had not said that, my soldiers would have pursued their brothers until the morning!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S22_28" data-id="S22_28">So Joab blew the trumpet, and all his men stopped and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S22_29" data-id="S22_29">Abner and his men traveled all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, marched all the next morning, and then reached Mahanaim.</span>
