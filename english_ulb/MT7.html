<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_2" data-id="MT7_2">For with the judgment you judge, you will be judged, and with the measure that you measure, it will be measured out to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_3" data-id="MT7_3">Why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_4" data-id="MT7_4">How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye,' while the log is in your own eye?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_5" data-id="MT7_5">You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brother's eye.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_6" data-id="MT7_6">Do not give what is holy to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls in front of the hogs. Otherwise they may trample them underfoot, and then turn and tear you to pieces.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_7" data-id="MT7_7">Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_8" data-id="MT7_8">For everyone who asks, receives; everyone who seeks, finds; and to the person who knocks, it will be opened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_9" data-id="MT7_9">Or which one of you, if his son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_10" data-id="MT7_10">Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_11" data-id="MT7_11">Therefore, if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him?</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_16" data-id="MT7_16">By their fruits you will know them. Do people gather grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_17" data-id="MT7_17">In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but the bad tree produces bad fruit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_18" data-id="MT7_18">A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_22" data-id="MT7_22">Many people will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, in your name drive out demons, and in your name do many mighty deeds?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_23" data-id="MT7_23">Then will I openly declare to them, 'I never knew you! Get away from me, you evildoers!'</span>

<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_24" data-id="MT7_24">Therefore, everyone who hears my words and obeys them will be like a wise man who built his house upon a rock.</span>

<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT7_29" data-id="MT7_29">for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.</span>
