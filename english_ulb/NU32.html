<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_1" data-id="NU32_1">Now the descendants of Reuben and of Gad had large numbers of livestock. When they saw the land of Jazer and Gilead, the land was a wonderful place for livestock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_2" data-id="NU32_2">So the descendants of Gad and Reuben came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the community. They said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_3" data-id="NU32_3">"This is a list of places we have surveyed: Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_4" data-id="NU32_4">These are the lands that Yahweh attacked before the community of Israel, and they are good places for livestock. We, your servants, have a lot of livestock."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_5" data-id="NU32_5">They said, "If we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to us, your servants, as a possession. Do not make us cross over the Jordan."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_6" data-id="NU32_6">Moses replied to the descendants of Gad and Reuben, "Should your brothers go to war while you settle down here?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_7" data-id="NU32_7">Why discourage the hearts of the people of Israel from going over into the land that Yahweh has given them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_8" data-id="NU32_8">Your fathers did the same thing when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to examine the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_9" data-id="NU32_9">They went up to the Valley of Eshkol. They saw the land and then discouraged the hearts of the people of Israel so that they refused to enter the land that Yahweh had given them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_10" data-id="NU32_10">Yahweh's anger was kindled on that day. He took an oath and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_11" data-id="NU32_11">'Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and up, will see the land about which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not completely followed me, except for</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_13" data-id="NU32_13">So Yahweh's anger was kindled against Israel. He made them wander around in the wilderness for forty years until all the generation who had done evil in his sight was destroyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_14" data-id="NU32_14">Look, you have risen up in your fathers' place, like just more sinful men, to add to Yahweh's burning anger toward Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_18" data-id="NU32_18">We will not return to our houses until every one of the people of Israel has obtained his inheritance.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_20" data-id="NU32_20">So Moses replied to them, "If you do what you say, if you arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to war,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_21" data-id="NU32_21">then every one of your armed men must cross over the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven out his enemies from before him</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_22" data-id="NU32_22">and the land is subdued before him. Then afterward you may return. You will be guiltless toward Yahweh and toward Israel. This land will be your possession before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_23" data-id="NU32_23">But if you do not do so, look, you will have sinned against Yahweh. Be sure that your sin will find you out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_24" data-id="NU32_24">Build cities for your families and pens for your sheep; then do what you have said."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_25" data-id="NU32_25">The descendants of Gad and Reuben spoke to Moses and said, "Your servants will do as you, our master, commands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_26" data-id="NU32_26">Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock will stay there in the cities of Gilead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_27" data-id="NU32_27">However, we, your servants, will cross over before Yahweh to battle, every man who is armed for war, as you, our master, say."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_28" data-id="NU32_28">So Moses gave instructions concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the leaders of the ancestor's clans in the tribes of the people of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_29" data-id="NU32_29">Moses said to them, "If the descendants of Gad and Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man who is armed to battle before Yahweh, and if the land is subdued before you, then you will give them the land of Gilead as a possession.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_30" data-id="NU32_30">But if they do not cross over with you armed, then they will acquire their possessions among you in the land of Canaan."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_31" data-id="NU32_31">So the descendants of Gad and Reuben answered and said, "As Yahweh has said to us, your servants, this is what we will do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_32" data-id="NU32_32">We will cross over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan, but our possessed inheritance will remain with us on this side of the Jordan."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_33" data-id="NU32_33">So to the descendants of Gad and Reuben, and also to the half tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph, Moses gave the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and of Og, king of Bashan. He gave to them the land, and distributed to them all its cities with their borders, the cities of the land around them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU32_34" data-id="NU32_34">The descendants of Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,</span>
