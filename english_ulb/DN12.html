There will be a time of trouble such as never was since the beginning of any nation until that time. At that time your people will be saved, everyone whose name is found written in the book.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN12_2" data-id="DN12_2">Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will rise up, some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN12_3" data-id="DN12_3">Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky above, and those who turn many to righteousness, are like the stars forever and ever.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN12_6" data-id="DN12_6">One of them said to the man clothed in linen, the one who was upstream along the river, "How long will it be to the end of these amazing events?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN12_7" data-id="DN12_7">I heard the man clothed in linen, who was upstream along the riverâ€”he raised his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swore by the one who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN12_8" data-id="DN12_8">I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, "My master, what will be the outcome of all these things?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN12_9" data-id="DN12_9">He said, "Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end.</span>
