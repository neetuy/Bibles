<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_1" data-id="JB2_1">Then it was the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh. Satan also came with them to present himself before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_2" data-id="JB2_2">Yahweh said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Then Satan answered Yahweh and said, "From wandering on the earth, from going back and forth on it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_3" data-id="JB2_3">Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil. He still holds fast to his integrity, although you misled me against him, to destroy him without cause."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_4" data-id="JB2_4">Satan answered Yahweh and said, "Skin for skin, indeed; a man will give all he has for his life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_5" data-id="JB2_5">But stretch out your hand now and touch his bones and his flesh, and see if he does not curse you to your face."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_6" data-id="JB2_6">Yahweh said to Satan, "See, he is in your hand; it is only his life that you must spare."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_7" data-id="JB2_7">Then Satan went away from the presence of Yahweh. He struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his feet to his head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_8" data-id="JB2_8">Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself with, and he sat down in the middle of ashes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_9" data-id="JB2_9">Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_10" data-id="JB2_10">But he said to her, "You talk as a foolish woman talks. Should we receive the good from God and not receive the bad?" In all this matter, Job did not sin with his lips.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_11" data-id="JB2_11">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, each of them came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They set a time to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_12" data-id="JB2_12">When they lifted up their eyes at a distance, they did not recognize him. They raised their voices and wept; each tore his robe and threw dust into the air and upon his own head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_13" data-id="JB2_13">Then they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights. No one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</span>
