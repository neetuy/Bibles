<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_2" data-id="R228_2">Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; he also made cast metal figures for the Baals.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_3" data-id="R228_3">In addition, he burned incense in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and he caused his children to pass through the fire, according to the idolatrous practices of the people that Yahweh forced out of their land before the people of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_4" data-id="R228_4">He sacrificed and burned incense at the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_5" data-id="R228_5">Therefore Yahweh the God of Ahaz gave him into the hand of the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated him and carried away from him a great crowd of prisoners, bringing them to Damascus. Ahaz was also given into the hand of the king of Israel who defeated him in a great slaughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_6" data-id="R228_6">For Pekah son of Remaliah in one day killed 120,000 soldiers in Judah and all of them were powerful men, because they had forsaken Yahweh the God of their ancestors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_7" data-id="R228_7">Zicri, a powerful man from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam, the official over the palace, and Elkanah, who was next to the king.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_9" data-id="R228_9">But a prophet of Yahweh was there, his name was Oded. He went out to meet the army coming into Samaria. He said to them, "Because Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reached up to heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_10" data-id="R228_10">Now you intend to keep the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem as your slaves. But are you not guilty of sins of your own against Yahweh your God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_11" data-id="R228_11">Now then, listen to me: Send the prisoners back, those whom you have taken of your own brothers, for Yahweh's fierce wrath is on you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_12" data-id="R228_12">Then certain leaders of the people of Ephraimâ€”Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came back from the war.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_13" data-id="R228_13">They said to them, "You must not bring the prisoners here, for you intend something that will bring on us sin against Yahweh, to add to our sins and trespasses, for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_14" data-id="R228_14">So the armed men left the prisoners and the plunder before the leaders and all the assembly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_15" data-id="R228_15">The men who were assigned by name got up and took the prisoners, and clothed all who were naked among them with the plunder.

They took them back to their families in Jericho, (called the City of Palms). Then they returned to Samaria.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_17" data-id="R228_17">For once again the Edomites had come and attacked Judah, carrying prisoners away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_18" data-id="R228_18">The Philistines also invaded the cities of the lowlands and of the Negev of Judah. They took Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soko with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and also Gimzo with its villages. They went to live in those places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_19" data-id="R228_19">For Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz, king of Israel; for he had acted wickedly in Judah and had sinned against Yahweh very heavily.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_20" data-id="R228_20">Tiglath-Pileser, king of Assyria, came to him and troubled him instead of strengthening him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_23" data-id="R228_23">For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, gods that had defeated him.

<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_24" data-id="R228_24">Ahaz gathered together the furnishings of the house of God and cut them to pieces. He shut the doors of the house of Yahweh and he made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_25" data-id="R228_25">In every city of Judah he made high places to burn sacrifices to other gods. He provoked Yahweh, the God of his ancestors, to anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_26" data-id="R228_26">Now the rest of his deeds, and all his ways, first and last, see, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_27" data-id="R228_27">Ahaz slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. Hezekiah, his son, became king in his place.</span>
