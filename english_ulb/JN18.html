<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_1" data-id="JN18_1">After Jesus spoke these words, he went out with his disciples to the other side of the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden into which he and his disciples entered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_2" data-id="JN18_2">Now Judas, who was going to betray him, also knew the place, for Jesus often went there with his disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_3" data-id="JN18_3">Then Judas, leading a group of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_4" data-id="JN18_4">Then Jesus, who knew all the things that were happening to him, went forward and asked them, "Who are you looking for?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_5" data-id="JN18_5">They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am." Judas, who betrayed him, was also standing with the soldiers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_6" data-id="JN18_6">So when he said to them, "I am," they went backward and fell to the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_7" data-id="JN18_7">Then again he asked them, "Who are you looking for?" Again they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_8" data-id="JN18_8">Jesus answered, "I told you that I am. So if you are looking for me, let these go."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_9" data-id="JN18_9">This was in order to fulfill the word that he said: "Of those whom you have given me, I lost no one."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_10" data-id="JN18_10">Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. Now the name of the servant was Malchus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_11" data-id="JN18_11">Jesus said to Peter, "Put the sword back into its sheath. Should I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_12" data-id="JN18_12">So the group of soldiers and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and tied him up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_13" data-id="JN18_13">They led him first to Annas, for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_14" data-id="JN18_14">Now Caiaphas was the one who had given the advice to the Jews that it would be better that one man die for the people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_15" data-id="JN18_15">Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_16" data-id="JN18_16">but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the female doorkeeper and he brought Peter in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_17" data-id="JN18_17">Then the female servant, the doorkeeper, said to Peter, "Are you not also one of the disciples of this man?" He said, "I am not."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_18" data-id="JN18_18">Now the servants and the officers were standing there, and they had made a charcoal fire, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter was also with them, standing there and warming himself.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_19" data-id="JN18_19">The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_20" data-id="JN18_20">Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world. I was always teaching in synagogues and in the temple where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_21" data-id="JN18_21">Why did you ask me? Ask those who have heard me about what I said. Look, these people know what I said."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_22" data-id="JN18_22">When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing there struck Jesus and said, "Is that how you answer the high priest?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_23" data-id="JN18_23">Jesus answered him, "If I spoke wrongly, testify about the wrong, but if rightly, why do you hit me?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_24" data-id="JN18_24">Then Annas sent him tied up to Caiaphas the high priest.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_25" data-id="JN18_25">Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. The people then said to him, "Are you not also one of his disciples?" He denied it and said, "I am not."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_26" data-id="JN18_26">One of the servants of the high priest, who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_27" data-id="JN18_27">Peter then denied again, and immediately the rooster crowed.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_28" data-id="JN18_28">Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the government headquarters. It was early in the morning, and they did not enter the government headquarters so that they would not be defiled but would eat the Passover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_29" data-id="JN18_29">So Pilate went out to them and said, "What accusation are you bringing against this man?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_30" data-id="JN18_30">They answered and said to him, "If this man was not an evildoer, we would not have given him over to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_31" data-id="JN18_31">Pilate therefore said to them, "Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law." The Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put any man to death."</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_32" data-id="JN18_32">They said this so that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled which he had spoken to indicate by what kind of death he would die.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_33" data-id="JN18_33">Then Pilate entered the government headquarters again and called Jesus and he said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_34" data-id="JN18_34">Jesus answered, "Do you speak from yourself, or did others speak to you about me?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_35" data-id="JN18_35">Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? Your own people and the chief priests gave you over to me. What did you do?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_36" data-id="JN18_36">Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, then my servants would fight so that I would not be given over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here."</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_37" data-id="JN18_37">Pilate then said to him, "Are you a king then?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this purpose I have been born, and for this purpose I have come into the world, so that I would bear witness to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_38" data-id="JN18_38">Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, "I find no guilt in this man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_39" data-id="JN18_39">But you have the custom that I release one person to you at the Passover. So do you want me to release the King of the Jews to you?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_40" data-id="JN18_40">Then they cried out again and said, "Not this man, but Barabbas." Now Barabbas was a robber.</span>
