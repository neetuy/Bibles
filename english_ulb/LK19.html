<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_3" data-id="LK19_3">He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd, because he was small in height.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_4" data-id="LK19_4">So he ran on ahead of the people and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was about to pass that way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_5" data-id="LK19_5">When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for today I must stay at your house."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_6" data-id="LK19_6">So he hurried and came down and welcomed him joyfully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_7" data-id="LK19_7">When everyone saw this, they all complained, saying, "He has gone in to visit a man who is a sinner."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_8" data-id="LK19_8">Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I will restore four times the amount."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_9" data-id="LK19_9">Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_10" data-id="LK19_10">For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the people who are lost."</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_15" data-id="LK19_15">It happened when he came back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded the servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what profit they had made by doing business.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_23" data-id="LK19_23">Then why did you not put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I would have collected it with interest?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_24" data-id="LK19_24">The nobleman said to them that stood by, 'Take away from him the mina, and give it to him that has the ten minas.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_29" data-id="LK19_29">It came about that when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the hill that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_30" data-id="LK19_30">saying, "Go into the next village. As you enter, you will find a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_31" data-id="LK19_31">If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord has need of it.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_32" data-id="LK19_32">Those who were sent went and found the colt just as Jesus had told them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_33" data-id="LK19_33">As they were untying the colt, the owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_34" data-id="LK19_34">They said, "The Lord has need of it."</span>

<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_43" data-id="LK19_43">For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build a barricade around you, and surround you, and press in on you from every side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_44" data-id="LK19_44">They will strike you down to the ground and your children with you. They will not leave one stone upon another, because you did not recognize it when God was trying to save you."</span>
