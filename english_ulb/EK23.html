<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_1" data-id="EK23_1">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_2" data-id="EK23_2">"Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_3" data-id="EK23_3">They acted as prostitutes in Egypt in the time of their youth. They acted as prostitutes there. Their breasts were squeezed and their virgin nipples were fondled there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_4" data-id="EK23_4">Their names were Oholah—the older sister—and Oholibah—her younger sister. Then they became mine and bore sons and daughters. Their names mean this: Oholah means Samaria, and Oholibah means Jerusalem.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_5" data-id="EK23_5">But Oholah acted as a prostitute even when she was mine; she lusted for her lovers, for the Assyrians who were dominant,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_6" data-id="EK23_6">the governor who wore blue, and for his officials, who were strong and handsome, all of them men riding on horses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_7" data-id="EK23_7">So she gave herself as a prostitute to them, to all the best of Assyria's men, and she made herself unclean with everyone she lusted for—and with all their idols.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_8" data-id="EK23_8">For she had not left her prostitute behavior behind in Egypt, when they had lain with her when she had been a young girl, when they caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_9" data-id="EK23_9">Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians for whom she lusted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_10" data-id="EK23_10">They uncovered her nakedness, took her sons and daughters, killed her with the sword, and she became notorious among other women, so they executed judgment on her.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_11" data-id="EK23_11">Her sister Oholibah saw this, but she lusted even more passionately and acted like a prostitute even more than her sister.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_12" data-id="EK23_12">She lusted for the Assyrians, the governors and the dominating officials who dressed impressively, who were men riding horses. All of them were strong, handsome men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_13" data-id="EK23_13">I saw that she had made herself unclean. It was the same for both sisters.  </span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_14" data-id="EK23_14">Then she increased her prostitution even more. She saw men carved on walls, figures of Chaldeans painted in red,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_15" data-id="EK23_15">wearing belts around their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads. All of them had the appearance of officers of chariot troops, the likeness of sons of Babylonia, whose native land is Chaldea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_16" data-id="EK23_16">As soon as her eyes saw them, she lusted for them, so she sent out messengers to them in Chaldea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_17" data-id="EK23_17">Then the Babylonians came to her and to her bed of lust, and they made her unclean with their promiscuousness. By what she had done she was made unclean, so she turned herself away from them in disgust.</span>

</div>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_18" data-id="EK23_18">When she displayed her acts of prostitution and uncovered her nakedness,</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EK23_18" data-id="EK23_18">I turned away from her, just as I had turned away in disgust from her sister.</div>

<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_26" data-id="EK23_26">They will strip you of your clothes and take away all of your jewelry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_27" data-id="EK23_27">So I will remove your shameful behavior from you and your acts of prostitution from the land of Egypt.

<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_28" data-id="EK23_28">For the Lord Yahweh says this, 'Behold! I will give you into the hand of the ones you hate, back into the hand of the ones from whom you had turned away.</span>

<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_38" data-id="EK23_38">Then they continue to do this to me: They make my sanctuary unclean, and on the same day they defile my Sabbaths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_39" data-id="EK23_39">For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, then they came to my sanctuary on the same day to defile it! So behold! This is what they have done in the middle of my house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_40" data-id="EK23_40">You sent out for men who came from far away, to whom messengers had been sent—now behold. They indeed came, those for whom you bathed, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_41" data-id="EK23_41">There you sat on a beautiful bed and at a table arranged before it where you placed my incense and my oil.</span>
