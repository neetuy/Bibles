<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_2" data-id="MT6_2">So when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before yourself as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have the praise of people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_3" data-id="MT6_3">But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</span>

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_6" data-id="MT6_6">But you, when you pray, enter your inner chamber. Shut the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_20" data-id="MT6_20">Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_21" data-id="MT6_21">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_22" data-id="MT6_22">The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_23" data-id="MT6_23">But if your eye is bad, your whole body is full of darkness. Therefore, if the light that is in you is actually darkness, how great is that darkness!</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_24" data-id="MT6_24">No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_25" data-id="MT6_25">Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink—or about your body, what you will wear. For is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_26" data-id="MT6_26">Look at the birds in the air. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not more valuable than they are?</span>

<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_28" data-id="MT6_28">Why are you anxious about clothing? Think about the lilies in the fields, how they grow. They do not work, and they do not spin cloth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_29" data-id="MT6_29">Yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.</span>

<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_31" data-id="MT6_31">Therefore do not be anxious and say, 'What will we eat?' or, 'What will we drink?' or, 'What clothes will we wear?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_32" data-id="MT6_32">For the Gentiles search for these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_33" data-id="MT6_33">But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you.</span>
