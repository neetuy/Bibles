<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_10" data-id="NH8_10">Then Nehemiah said to them, "Go your way, eat the fat and have something sweet to drink, and send some of it to one who has nothing prepared, for this day is holy to our Lord.

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_16" data-id="NH8_16">So the people went out and brought the branches back and made themselves shelters, each on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God, in the open area in front of the Water Gate, and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_17" data-id="NH8_17">All the assembly of those who had returned from captivity made shelters and lived in them.
