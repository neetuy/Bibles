<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_2" data-id="GN13_2">Now Abram was very rich in animals, in silver, and in gold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_3" data-id="GN13_3">He continued on his journey from the Negev to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been before, between Bethel and Ai.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_4" data-id="GN13_4">He went to the place where the altar was that he had built previously. Here he called on the name of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_5" data-id="GN13_5">Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_6" data-id="GN13_6">The land was not able to support them both living close together, because their possessions were very many, so that they could not stay together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_7" data-id="GN13_7">Also, there was a dispute between the herdsmen of Abram's animals and the herdsmen of Lot's animals. The Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land at that time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_8" data-id="GN13_8">So Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; after all, we are family.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_9" data-id="GN13_9">Is not the whole land before you? Go ahead and separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right, then I will go to the left."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_10" data-id="GN13_10">So Lot looked around, and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered everywhere all the way to Zoar, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt. This was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_11" data-id="GN13_11">So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan and traveled east, and the relatives separated from each other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_12" data-id="GN13_12">Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived among the cities of the plain. He set up his tents as far away as Sodom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_13" data-id="GN13_13">Now the men of Sodom were very wicked sinners against Yahweh.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_14" data-id="GN13_14">Yahweh said to Abram after Lot had departed from him, "Look from the place where you are standing to the north, south, east, and west.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_16" data-id="GN13_16">I will make your descendants as abundant as the dust of the earth, so that if a man could count the dust of the earth, then your descendants could also be counted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_17" data-id="GN13_17">Arise, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I will give it to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_18" data-id="GN13_18">So Abram picked up his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there built an altar to Yahweh.</span>
