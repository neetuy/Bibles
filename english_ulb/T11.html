<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_2" data-id="T11_2">to Timothy, a true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>

<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_3" data-id="T11_3">As I urged you to do when I was leaving for Macedonia, remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain people not to teach a different doctrine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_4" data-id="T11_4">Neither should they pay attention to stories and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, which is by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_5" data-id="T11_5">Now the goal of this command is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_8" data-id="T11_8">But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_9" data-id="T11_9">We know this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for lawless and rebellious people, for ungodly people and sinners, for those who are godless and profane, for those who kill their fathers and mothers, for murderers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_10" data-id="T11_10">for sexually immoral people, for homosexuals, for those who kidnap people for slaves, for liars, for false witnesses, and for whatever else is contrary to faithful instruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_11" data-id="T11_11">This instruction is according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_13" data-id="T11_13">In the past, I was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and a violent man, but I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_14" data-id="T11_14">But the grace of our Lord overflowed with faith and love that is in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_15" data-id="T11_15">This message is reliable and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_16" data-id="T11_16">But for this reason I was given mercy, so that in me, the foremost, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all patience as an example for those who would trust in him for eternal life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_17" data-id="T11_17">Now to the king of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>
