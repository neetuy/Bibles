<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_2" data-id="GN44_2">Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's opening of the youngest, and also his money for the grain." The steward did as Joseph had said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_3" data-id="GN44_3">The morning dawned, and the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_4" data-id="GN44_4">When they were out of the city but were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, "Get up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you returned evil for good?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_5" data-id="GN44_5">Is this not the cup from which my master drinks, and the cup that he uses for divination? You have done evil, this thing that you have done.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_6" data-id="GN44_6">The steward overtook them and spoke these words to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_7" data-id="GN44_7">They said to him, "Why does my master speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they would do such a thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_8" data-id="GN44_8">Look, the money that we found in our sacks' openings, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then could we steal out of your master's house silver or gold?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_9" data-id="GN44_9">With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my master's slaves."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_10" data-id="GN44_10">The steward said, "Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom the cup is found will be my slave, and you others will be innocent."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_11" data-id="GN44_11">Then each man hurried and brought his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_12" data-id="GN44_12">The steward searched. He began with the oldest and finished with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_13" data-id="GN44_13">Then they tore their clothes. Each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_14" data-id="GN44_14">Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house. He was still there, and they bowed before him to the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_15" data-id="GN44_15">Joseph said to them, "What is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me practices divination?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_16" data-id="GN44_16">Judah said, "What can we say to my master? What can we speak? Or how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Look, we are my master's slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup was found."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_17" data-id="GN44_17">Joseph said, "Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup was found, that person will be my slave, but as for you others, go up in peace to your father."</span>

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_18" data-id="GN44_18">Then Judah came near to him and said, "My master, please let your servant speak a word in my master's ears, and do let your anger burn against your servant, for you are just like Pharaoh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_19" data-id="GN44_19">My master asked his servants, saying, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_21" data-id="GN44_21">Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me that I may see him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_22" data-id="GN44_22">After that, we said to my master, 'The boy cannot leave his father. For if he should leave his father his father would die.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_23" data-id="GN44_23">Then you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_24" data-id="GN44_24">Then it came about when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my master.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_25" data-id="GN44_25">Our father said, 'Go again, buy us some food.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_26" data-id="GN44_26">Then we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then will we go down, for we will not be able to see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_27" data-id="GN44_27">Your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_28" data-id="GN44_28">One of them went out from me and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_29" data-id="GN44_29">Now if you also take this one from me, and harm comes to him, you will bring down my gray hair with sorrow to Sheol.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_30" data-id="GN44_30">Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the boy's life,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_31" data-id="GN44_31">it will come about, when he sees the boy is not with us, he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_32" data-id="GN44_32">For your servant became a guarantee for the boy to my father and said, 'If I do not bring him to you, then I will bear the guilt to my father forever.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_33" data-id="GN44_33">Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy as slave to my master, and let the boy go up with his brothers.</span>
