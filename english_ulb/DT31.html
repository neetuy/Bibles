<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_14" data-id="DT31_14">Yahweh said to Moses, "Look, the day is coming when you must die; call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, so that I may give him a command." Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_15" data-id="DT31_15">Yahweh appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud; the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_16" data-id="DT31_16">Yahweh said to Moses, "Look, you will sleep with your fathers; this people will rise up and act like a prostitute going after the strange gods that are among them in the land where they are going. They will forsake me and break my covenant that I have made with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_17" data-id="DT31_17">Then, on that day, my anger will be kindled against them and I will abandon them. I will hide my face from them and they will be devoured. Many disasters and troubles will find them so that they will say on that day, 'Have these disasters not come upon us because our God is not in our midst?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_18" data-id="DT31_18">I will surely hide my face from them on that day because of all the evil that they will have done, because they has turned to other gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_19" data-id="DT31_19">Now therefore write this song for yourselves and teach it to the people of Israel. Put it in their mouths, so that this song may be a witness for me against the people of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_20" data-id="DT31_20">For when I will have brought them into the land that I swore to give to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey, and when they have eaten and become satisfied and fat, then they will turn to other gods and they will serve them and they will despise me and they will break my covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_21" data-id="DT31_21">When many evils and troubles come upon this people, this song will testify before them as a witness (for it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants). For I know the plans that they are forming today, even before I have brought them into the land that I promised them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_22" data-id="DT31_22">So Moses wrote this song the same day and taught it to the people of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_23" data-id="DT31_23">Yahweh gave Joshua son of Nun a command and said, "Be strong and of good courage; for you will bring the people of Israel into the land that I swore to them, and I will be with you."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_24" data-id="DT31_24">It happened that when Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_25" data-id="DT31_25">that he commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and he said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_26" data-id="DT31_26">"Take this book of the law and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, so that it may be there as a witness against you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_27" data-id="DT31_27">For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck; look, while I am still alive with you even today, you have been rebellious against Yahweh; how much more after my death?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_28" data-id="DT31_28">Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, so that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to witness against them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_29" data-id="DT31_29">For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside out of the path that I have commanded you; disaster will come on you in the following days. This will happen because you will do what is evil in the sight of Yahweh, so as to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT31_30" data-id="DT31_30">Moses recited in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song until they were finished.</span>
