<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_4" data-id="EK35_4">I will make your cities ruins, and you yourself will become desolate; then you will know that I am Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_5" data-id="EK35_5">Because you have always been hostile to the people of Israel, and because you poured them out into the hands of the sword at the time of their distress, at the time their punishment was at its greatest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_6" data-id="EK35_6">Therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—I will prepare you for bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you! Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_10" data-id="EK35_10">You have said, "These two nations and these two lands will become mine, and we will possess them," even when Yahweh was present with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_11" data-id="EK35_11">Therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—so I will do according to your anger and according to your jealousy that you had in your hatred of Israel, and I will show myself to them when I judge you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_12" data-id="EK35_12">So you will know that I am Yahweh.
