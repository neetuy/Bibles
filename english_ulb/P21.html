<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_4" data-id="P21_4">Through these, he gave us precious and great promises, so that you might be sharers in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world that is caused by evil desires.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_5" data-id="P21_5">For this reason, do your best to add goodness to your faith; and to goodness add knowledge;</span>

<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_12" data-id="P21_12">Therefore I will always be ready to remind you of these things, although you know them, and although you are strong in the truth you now have.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_13" data-id="P21_13">It is proper for me to think, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by way of reminder.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_16" data-id="P21_16">For we did not follow cleverly invented myths when we made known to  you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_17" data-id="P21_17">For he received honor and glory from God the Father when a voice was brought to him by the Majestic Glory saying, "This is my beloved Son, with him I am well pleased."</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_20" data-id="P21_20">Above all, you must understand that no prophecy comes from someone's own interpretation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_21" data-id="P21_21">For no prophecy was ever brought by the will of man, but men spoke from God when they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</span>
