<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_6" data-id="DT29_6">You did not eat any bread, and you did not drink any wine or other alcoholic drinks, so that you might know that I am Yahweh your God.</span>

Make sure there is not among you any root that produces gall and wormwood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_19" data-id="DT29_19">When that person hears the words of this curse, he will bless himself in his heart and say, 'I will have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart.' This would destroy the wet together with the dry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_20" data-id="DT29_20">Yahweh will not pardon him, but instead, the anger of Yahweh and his jealousy will smolder against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book will come on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_21" data-id="DT29_21">Yahweh will set him apart for disaster out of all the tribes of Israel, in keeping with all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_23" data-id="DT29_23">and when they see that the whole land has become sulfur and burning salt, where nothing is sown or bears fruit, where no vegetation grows, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, that Yahweh destroyed in his anger and wrath—</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_24" data-id="DT29_24">they will say together with all the other nations, 'Why has Yahweh done this to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_25" data-id="DT29_25">Then people will say, 'It is because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, that he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_26" data-id="DT29_26">and because they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods that they had not known and that he had not given to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_27" data-id="DT29_27">Therefore the anger of Yahweh has been kindled against this land, so as to bring on it all the curses that are written in this book.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_28" data-id="DT29_28">Yahweh has uprooted them from their land in anger, in wrath, and in great fury, and has thrown them into another land, as today.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_29" data-id="DT29_29">The secret matters belong alone to Yahweh our God; but the things that are revealed belong forever to us and to our descendants, so that we may do all the words of this law.</span>
