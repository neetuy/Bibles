<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_2" data-id="T24_2">Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all patience and teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_3" data-id="T24_3">For the time will come when people will not endure sound teaching. Instead, they will heap up for themselves teachers according to their own desires, having itching ears to hear,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_4" data-id="T24_4">and will turn their hearing away from the truth, and indeed they will be turned aside to myths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_5" data-id="T24_5">But you, be sober-minded in all things. Suffer hardship; do the work of an evangelist; fulfill your service.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_10" data-id="T24_10">for Demas has deserted me, having loved this present age, and has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</span>
