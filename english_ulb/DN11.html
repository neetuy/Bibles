<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_2" data-id="DN11_2">Now I will tell you the truth. Three kings will arise in Persia, and a fourth will be far richer than all the others. When he has gained power through his riches, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_3" data-id="DN11_3">A mighty king will rise up who will rule a very great kingdom, and he will act according to his desires.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_5" data-id="DN11_5">The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his kingdom with great power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_6" data-id="DN11_6">After a few years, when the time is right, they will make an alliance. The daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to confirm the agreement. But she will not keep her arm's strength, nor will he stand, or his arm. She will be abandoned—she and those who brought her, and her father, and the one who supported her in those times. <span class="note" id="footnote-206"><a href="#note-206" class="key">†</a></span></span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_7" data-id="DN11_7">But a branch from her roots will rise up in her place. He will attack the army and enter the fortress of the king of the North. He will fight them, and he will conquer them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_8" data-id="DN11_8">He will carry off to Egypt their gods along with their cast metal figures and their precious vessels of silver and of gold. For some years he will stay away from the king of the North.</span>

He will spread among his followers the booty, the plunder, and the wealth. He will plan the overthrow of fortresses, but only for a time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_25" data-id="DN11_25">He will wake up his power and his heart against the king of the South with a great army.

<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_26" data-id="DN11_26">Even those who eat his fine food will try to destroy him. His army will be swept away like a flood, and many of them will fall killed.</span>

<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_38" data-id="DN11_38">He will honor the god of fortresses instead of these. It is a god whom his fathers did not acknowledge that he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and valuable gifts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_39" data-id="DN11_39">He will attack the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god.
