<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_1" data-id="DN7_1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylonia, Daniel had a dream and visions in his mind while lying on his bed. Then he wrote down what he had seen in the dream. He wrote down the most important events:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_2" data-id="DN7_2">Daniel explained, "In my vision at night I saw that the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_3" data-id="DN7_3">Four large animals, each one different from the other, came up out of the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_4" data-id="DN7_4">The first was like a lion but had eagle's wings. As I was looking, its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground and made to stand on two feet, like a man. The mind of a man was given to it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_5" data-id="DN7_5">Then there was a second animal, like a bear, and it was bending over; it had three ribs between its teeth in its mouth. It was told, 'Get up and devour many people.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_6" data-id="DN7_6">After this I looked again. There was another animal, one that looked like a leopard. On its back it had four wings like bird wings, and it had four heads. It was given authority to rule.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_7" data-id="DN7_7">After this I saw in the visions of the night a fourth animal, terrifying, frightening, and very strong. It had large iron teeth; it devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled underfoot what was left. It was different from the other animals, and it had ten horns.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_8" data-id="DN7_8">While I was considering the horns, I looked and saw another horn grow up among them, a little horn. Three of the first horns were wrenched out by the roots. I saw in this horn eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that was boasting about great things.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">As I looked,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">thrones were set in place,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">and the Ancient of Days took his seat.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">His clothing was as white as snow,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">and the hair of his head was like pure wool.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">His throne was flames of fire,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">and its wheels were burning fire.</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_10" data-id="DN7_10">A river of fire flowed out from before him;</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_10" data-id="DN7_10">millions served him,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_10" data-id="DN7_10">and one hundred million were standing before him.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_10" data-id="DN7_10">The court was in session,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_10" data-id="DN7_10">and the books were opened.</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_11" data-id="DN7_11">I continued to look because of the boastful words spoken by the horn. I watched while the animal was killed, and its body was destroyed, and it was given over to be burned up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_12" data-id="DN7_12">As for the rest of the four animals, their authority to rule was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a period of time.</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_13" data-id="DN7_13">In my visions that night,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_13" data-id="DN7_13">I saw one coming with the clouds of heaven like a son of man;</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_13" data-id="DN7_13">he came to the Ancient of Days</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_13" data-id="DN7_13">and was presented before him.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_14" data-id="DN7_14">Authority to rule and glory and royal power were given to him</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_14" data-id="DN7_14">so that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_14" data-id="DN7_14">His authority to rule is an everlasting authority that will not pass away,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_14" data-id="DN7_14">and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_15" data-id="DN7_15">As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved inside of me, and the visions I saw in my mind troubled me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_16" data-id="DN7_16">I approached one of them standing there and asked him to show me the meaning of these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_17" data-id="DN7_17">'These large animals, four in number, are four kings that will arise from the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_18" data-id="DN7_18">But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and they will possess it forever and ever.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_19" data-id="DN7_19">Then I wanted to know more about the fourth animalâ€”it was so different from the others and very horrifying with its iron teeth and bronze claws; it devoured, broke into pieces, and trampled on what was left with its feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_20" data-id="DN7_20">I wanted to know about the ten horns on its head, and about the other horn that grew up, and before which the three horns fell down. I wanted to know about the horn that had eyes and about the mouth that boasted about great things and that seemed greater than its companions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_21" data-id="DN7_21">As I looked, this horn waged war against the holy people and was defeating them</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_22" data-id="DN7_22">until the Ancient of Days came, and justice was given to the holy people of the Most High. Then the time came when the holy people received the kingdom.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_23" data-id="DN7_23">This is what that person said, 'As for the fourth animal,</span>
