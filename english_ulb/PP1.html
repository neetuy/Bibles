<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_3" data-id="PP1_3">I thank my God every time I remember you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_4" data-id="PP1_4">and always in every prayer for all of you, I pray with joy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_5" data-id="PP1_5">I give thanks for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_6" data-id="PP1_6">I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_7" data-id="PP1_7">It is right for me to feel this way about all of you because I have you in my heart. You all have been my partners in grace both in my imprisonment and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_8" data-id="PP1_8">For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_11" data-id="PP1_11">I pray that you also will be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_12" data-id="PP1_12">Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_13" data-id="PP1_13">As a result, my chains in Christ came to light throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_14" data-id="PP1_14">Most of the brothers have far more confidence in the Lord because of my chains, and they have courage to fearlessly speak the word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_15" data-id="PP1_15">Some indeed even proclaim Christ out of envy and strife, and also others out of good will.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_16" data-id="PP1_16">The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_17" data-id="PP1_17">But the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely. They think they will afflict me while I am in chains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_18" data-id="PP1_18">What then? Only that in every way—whether from false motives or from true—Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_19" data-id="PP1_19">for I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_20" data-id="PP1_20">It is my eager expectation and certain hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but that I will have complete boldness, so that now as always, Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_21" data-id="PP1_21">For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_22" data-id="PP1_22">But if I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which to choose? I do not know.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_23" data-id="PP1_23">For I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, which is far better,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_24" data-id="PP1_24">yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_25" data-id="PP1_25">Being convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_26" data-id="PP1_26">so that in me you may have increasing reasons to boast in Christ Jesus when I come to you again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_27" data-id="PP1_27">Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come to see you or am absent, I may hear about you, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_28" data-id="PP1_28">Do not be frightened in any respect by those who are your opponents. This is a sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation—and this from God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_29" data-id="PP1_29">For it has been granted to you, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_30" data-id="PP1_30">having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now you hear in me.</span>
