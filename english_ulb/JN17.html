<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_2" data-id="JN17_2">just as you gave him authority over all flesh so that he would give eternal life to everyone whom you have given him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_3" data-id="JN17_3">This is eternal life: That they know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_4" data-id="JN17_4">I glorified you on the earth. I have finished the work that you have given me to do.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_7" data-id="JN17_7">Now they know that everything that you have given me comes from you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_8" data-id="JN17_8">for I have given them all the words that you gave me. They received them and truly knew that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_21" data-id="JN17_21">so that they will all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world will believe that you have sent me.</span>
