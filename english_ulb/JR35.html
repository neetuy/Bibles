<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_3" data-id="JR35_3">So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah and his brothers, all his sons, and all the family of the Rekabites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_4" data-id="JR35_4">I took them to the house of Yahweh, into the rooms of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God.

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_6" data-id="JR35_6">But they said, "We will not drink any wine, for our ancestor, Jonadab son of Rekab, commanded us, 'Do not drink any wine, neither you nor your descendants, forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_7" data-id="JR35_7">Also, do not build any houses, sow any seeds, or plant any vineyards; this is not for you.

<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_8" data-id="JR35_8">We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab son of Rekab, our ancestor, in all that he commanded us, to never drink wine all of our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_9" data-id="JR35_9">We will never build houses to live in, and there will be no vineyard, field, or seed in our possession.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_12" data-id="JR35_12">Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_13" data-id="JR35_13">"Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, 'Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, "Will you not receive correction and listen to my words? —this is Yahweh's declaration.</span>

They have obeyed their ancestor's command. But as for me, I myself have been making persistent proclamations to you, but you do not listen to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_15" data-id="JR35_15">I sent out to you all my servants, the prophets. I was persistent in sending them to say, 'Let each person turn from his wicked way and do good deeds; let no one walk any longer after other gods and worship them. Instead, come back to the land that I gave to you and your ancestors.' Yet you will not listen to me or pay attention to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_16" data-id="JR35_16">For the descendants of Jonadab son of Rekab have observed the commands of their ancestor that he gave them, but this people refuses to listen to me."'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR35_17" data-id="JR35_17">So Yahweh, God of hosts and God of Israel, says this, 'Look, I am bringing upon Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem, all the disasters I pronounced against them because I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.'"</span>
