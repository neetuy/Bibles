<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_1" data-id="LK15_1">Now all the tax collectors and other sinners were coming to Jesus to listen to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_2" data-id="LK15_2">Both the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled to each other, saying, "This man welcomes sinners, and even eats with them."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_3" data-id="LK15_3">Jesus spoke this parable to them, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_4" data-id="LK15_4">"Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep and then loses one of them, will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the lost one until he finds it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_5" data-id="LK15_5">Then when he has found it, he lays it across his shoulders and rejoices.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_6" data-id="LK15_6">When he comes to the house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_7" data-id="LK15_7">I say to you that even so, there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_8" data-id="LK15_8">Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she were to lose one coin, would not light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she has found it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_9" data-id="LK15_9">When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_10" data-id="LK15_10">Even so, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_11" data-id="LK15_11">Then Jesus said, "A certain man had two sons,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_12" data-id="LK15_12">and the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the portion of the wealth that falls to me.' So he divided his property between them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_13" data-id="LK15_13">Not many days later, the younger son gathered together all he owned and went to a country far away, and there he wasted all his wealth by living recklessly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_14" data-id="LK15_14">Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine spread through that country, and he began to be in need.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_15" data-id="LK15_15">He went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_16" data-id="LK15_16">He would gladly have eaten the carob pods that the pigs ate, because no one gave him anything.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_17" data-id="LK15_17">But when the young son came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough food, and I am here, dying from hunger!</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_18" data-id="LK15_18">I will leave here and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_19" data-id="LK15_19">I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired servants."'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_20" data-id="LK15_20">So the young son left and came toward his father. While he was still far away, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and embraced him and kissed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_21" data-id="LK15_21">The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_22" data-id="LK15_22">The father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_23" data-id="LK15_23">Then bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let us celebrate with a feast!</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_24" data-id="LK15_24">For my son was dead, and now he is alive. He was lost, and now he is found.' Then they began to celebrate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_25" data-id="LK15_25">Now his older son was out in the field. As he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_26" data-id="LK15_26">He called to one of the servants and asked what these things might be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_27" data-id="LK15_27">The servant said to him, 'Your brother has come home and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has returned safely.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_28" data-id="LK15_28">The older son was angry and would not go in, and his father came out and begged him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_29" data-id="LK15_29">But the older son answered and said to his father, 'Look, these many years I slaved for you, and I never broke a rule of yours, and yet you never gave me a young goat that I might celebrate with my friends,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_30" data-id="LK15_30">but when your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed for him the fattened calf.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_31" data-id="LK15_31">The father said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_32" data-id="LK15_32">But it was proper for us to feast and be happy, for this brother of yours was dead, and is now alive; he was lost, and has now been found.'"</span>
