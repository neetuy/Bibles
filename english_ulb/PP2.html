<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_13" data-id="PP2_13">For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_14" data-id="PP2_14">Do all things without complaining or arguing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_15" data-id="PP2_15">Act in this way so that you may become blameless and honest, children of God without blemish.

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_16" data-id="PP2_16">Hold tightly to the word of life so that I may have reason to glory on the day of Christ. For then I will know that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_17" data-id="PP2_17">But even if I am being poured out as an offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_18" data-id="PP2_18">In the same manner you also should be glad and rejoice with me.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_19" data-id="PP2_19">But I have hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may also be encouraged when I know the things about you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_20" data-id="PP2_20">For I have no one else with his same attitude, who is truly anxious for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_21" data-id="PP2_21">For they all seek their own interests, not the things of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_22" data-id="PP2_22">But you know his worth, because as a son with his father, so he served with me in the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_23" data-id="PP2_23">So I hope to send him as soon as I see how things will go with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_24" data-id="PP2_24">But I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_25" data-id="PP2_25">But I think it is necessary to send Epaphroditus back to you. He is my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and servant for my needs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_26" data-id="PP2_26">For he was very distressed, and he longed to be with you all, because you heard that he was sick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_27" data-id="PP2_27">For indeed he was so sick that he almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_28" data-id="PP2_28">So it is all the more eagerly that I am sending him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I can be free from anxiety.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_29" data-id="PP2_29">Welcome Epaphroditus in the Lord with all joy. Honor people like him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_30" data-id="PP2_30">For it was for the work of Christ that he came near death. He risked his life to serve me and fill up what you could not do in service to me.</span>
