<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_4" data-id="EK25_4">therefore, behold, I am giving you to a people in the east as their possession.

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_5" data-id="EK25_5">I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the people of Ammon a field for flocks. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_6" data-id="EK25_6">For the Lord Yahweh says this: You have clapped your hands and stamped your feet, and rejoiced with all the contempt within you against the land of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_7" data-id="EK25_7">Therefore, behold! I will strike you with my hand and give you as plunder to the nations.
