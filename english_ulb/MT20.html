<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_2" data-id="MT20_2">After he had agreed with the workers for one denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_3" data-id="MT20_3">He went out again about the third hour and saw other workers standing idle in the marketplace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_4" data-id="MT20_4">To them he said, 'You also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went to work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_5" data-id="MT20_5">Again he went out about the sixth hour and again the ninth hour, and did the same.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_6" data-id="MT20_6">Once more about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle. He said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all the day long?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_7" data-id="MT20_7">They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_8" data-id="MT20_8">When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_9" data-id="MT20_9">When the workers who had been hired at the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_10" data-id="MT20_10">When the first workers came, they thought that they would receive more, but they also received one denarius each.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_11" data-id="MT20_11">When they received their wages, they complained about the landowner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_12" data-id="MT20_12">They said, 'These last workers have spent only one hour in work, but you have made them equal to us, we who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_13" data-id="MT20_13">But the owner answered and said to one of them, 'Friend, I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for one denarius?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_14" data-id="MT20_14">Take what belongs to you and go your way. I choose to give to these last hired workers just the same as to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_15" data-id="MT20_15">Do I not have the right to do as I want with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_16" data-id="MT20_16">So the last will be first, and the first last." <span class="note" id="footnote-238"><a href="#note-238" class="key">†</a></span></span>

<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_17" data-id="MT20_17">As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside, and on the way he said to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_18" data-id="MT20_18">"See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn him to death</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_19" data-id="MT20_19">and will deliver him to the Gentiles for them to mock, to flog, and to crucify him. But on the third day he will be raised up."</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_20" data-id="MT20_20">Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons. She bowed down before him and asked for something from him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_21" data-id="MT20_21">Jesus said to her, "What do you wish?" She said to him, "Command that these my two sons may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left hand, in your kingdom."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_22" data-id="MT20_22">But Jesus answered and said, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him, "We are able."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_23" data-id="MT20_23">He said to them, "My cup you will indeed drink. But to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_24" data-id="MT20_24">When the other ten disciples heard this, they were very angry with the two brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_25" data-id="MT20_25">But Jesus called them to himself and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles subjugate them, and their important men exercise authority over them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_26" data-id="MT20_26">But it must not be this way among you. Instead, whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_27" data-id="MT20_27">and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your servant,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_28" data-id="MT20_28">just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</span>

<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_29" data-id="MT20_29">As they went out from Jericho, a great crowd followed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_30" data-id="MT20_30">There were two blind men sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_31" data-id="MT20_31">The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet, but they cried out even more loudly, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_32" data-id="MT20_32">Then Jesus stood still and called to them and said, "What do you wish me to do for you?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_33" data-id="MT20_33">They said to him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened."</span>
