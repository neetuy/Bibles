<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_1" data-id="GL4_1">I am saying that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is owner of the entire estate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_2" data-id="GL4_2">But he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by his father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_3" data-id="GL4_3">So also, when we were children, we were enslaved to the elemental principles of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_4" data-id="GL4_4">But when the fullness of time had come, God sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_5" data-id="GL4_5">He did this to redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_6" data-id="GL4_6">And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls out, "Abba, Father."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_7" data-id="GL4_7">So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then you are also an heir through God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_8" data-id="GL4_8">But at that time, when you did not know God, you were made to be slaves to those who are, by their natural powers, not gods at all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_9" data-id="GL4_9">But now that you have come to know God, or rather that you are known by God, how is it that you are turning back to the weak and worthless elemental principles? Do you want to be enslaved all over again?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_10" data-id="GL4_10">You observe days and new moons and seasons and years!</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_11" data-id="GL4_11">I am afraid for you that somehow my work with you may have been for nothing.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_12" data-id="GL4_12">I beg you, brothers, become like me, for I also have become like you. You did me no wrong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_13" data-id="GL4_13">But you know that it was because of a physical illness that I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_14" data-id="GL4_14">Though my physical condition put you to the test, you did not despise or reject me. Instead you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_15" data-id="GL4_15">Where, then, is your blessing now? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_16" data-id="GL4_16">So then, have I become your enemy because I am telling you the truth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_17" data-id="GL4_17">They are zealous to win you over, but for no good. They want to shut you out, so you may be zealous for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_18" data-id="GL4_18">It is always good to be zealous for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_19" data-id="GL4_19">My little children, again I am in the pains of childbirth for you until Christ is formed in you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_20" data-id="GL4_20">I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_21" data-id="GL4_21">Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_22" data-id="GL4_22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave girl and one by the free woman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_23" data-id="GL4_23">One was born by the slave girl according to the flesh, but the other was born by the free woman through promise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_24" data-id="GL4_24">These things may be interpreted as an allegory, for these women represent two covenants. One of them is from Mount Sinai and she gives birth to children who are slaves. This is Hagar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_25" data-id="GL4_25">Now Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia; and she represents the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_26" data-id="GL4_26">But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">For it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">"Rejoice, you barren one who does not give birth;</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">cry out and shout for joy, you who are not suffering the pains of childbirth;</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">because the children of the abandoned woman are more numerous</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">than those of the woman who has a husband."</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_28" data-id="GL4_28">But you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_29" data-id="GL4_29">At that time the one who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit. It is the same now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_30" data-id="GL4_30">But what does the scripture say? "Send away the slave girl and her son. For the son of the slave girl will not share in the inheritance with the son of the free woman."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_31" data-id="GL4_31">Therefore, brothers, we are not children of a slave girl, but of the free woman.</span>
