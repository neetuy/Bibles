<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_3" data-id="DT11_3">the signs and deeds that he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to all his land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_4" data-id="DT11_4">Neither did they see what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, or to their chariots, how he made the water of the Sea of Reeds overwhelm them as they pursued after you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them until today,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_5" data-id="DT11_5">or what he did for you in the wilderness until you came to this place.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_9" data-id="DT11_9">and that you may prolong your days in the land that Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_10" data-id="DT11_10">For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not like the land of Egypt, from where you came, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot, like a garden of herbs;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_11" data-id="DT11_11">but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of the heavens,</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_20" data-id="DT11_20">You will write them on the doorposts of your house and on your city gates,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_21" data-id="DT11_21">that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors to give them for as long as the heavens are above the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_22" data-id="DT11_22">For if you diligently keep all these commandments that I am commanding you, so as to do them, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_23" data-id="DT11_23">then Yahweh will drive out all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and mightier than yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_24" data-id="DT11_24">Every place where the sole of your foot will tread will be yours; from the wilderness to Lebanon, from the river, the Euphrates River, to the western sea will be your border.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_25" data-id="DT11_25">No man will be able to stand before you. Yahweh your God will lay the fear of you and the terror of you upon all the land that you tread on, as he has said to you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_26" data-id="DT11_26">Look, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_27" data-id="DT11_27">the blessing, if you obey the commandments of Yahweh your God that I command you today,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_28" data-id="DT11_28">and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn aside from the way that I command you today, to go after other gods that you have not known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_29" data-id="DT11_29">It will happen, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land which you go to possess, that you will set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.</span>
