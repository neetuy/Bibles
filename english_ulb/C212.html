<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_1" data-id="C212_1">I must boast, but nothing is gained by it. But I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_2" data-id="C212_2">I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago who—whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—was caught up into the third heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_3" data-id="C212_3">And I know that this man—whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_4" data-id="C212_4">was caught up into paradise and heard things too sacred for anyone to say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_5" data-id="C212_5">On behalf of such a person I will boast. But on behalf of myself I will not boast, except about my weaknesses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_6" data-id="C212_6">If I should choose to boast, I will not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I will keep from boasting, so that no one will think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_7" data-id="C212_7">To keep me from boasting because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger from Satan to afflict me—so I would not become overly proud.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_8" data-id="C212_8">Three times I begged the Lord about this, for him to take it away from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_9" data-id="C212_9">But he said to me, "My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." So I would much rather boast about my weakness, so that the power of Christ might reside on me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_10" data-id="C212_10">Therefore I am content for Christ's sake in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions and distressing situations. For whenever I am weak, then I am strong.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_11" data-id="C212_11">I have become a fool! You forced me to this, for I should have been praised by you. For I was not at all inferior to the so-called super-apostles, even though I am nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_12" data-id="C212_12">The true signs of an apostle were performed among you with complete patience, signs and wonders and mighty deeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_13" data-id="C212_13">For how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me for this wrong!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_14" data-id="C212_14">Look! I am ready to come to you a third time. I will not be a burden to you, for I do not want what is yours. I want you. For children should not save up for the parents. Instead, the parents should save up for the children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_15" data-id="C212_15">I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_16" data-id="C212_16">But as it is, I did not burden you. But, since I am so crafty, I am the one who caught you by deceit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_17" data-id="C212_17">Did I take advantage of you by anyone I sent to you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_18" data-id="C212_18">I urged Titus to go to you, and I sent the other brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same way? Did we not walk in the same steps?</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_19" data-id="C212_19">Do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you? In the sight of God, we have in Christ been saying everything for your strengthening.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_20" data-id="C212_20">For I fear that when I come I may not find you as I wish. I fear that you might not find me as you wish. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, rivalries, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_21" data-id="C212_21">I fear that when I come back, my God might humble me before you. I fear that I might be grieved by many of those who have sinned before now, and who did not repent of the impurity and sexual immorality and lustful indulgence that they practiced.</span>
