<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_2" data-id="JG14_2">When he returned, he told his father and mother, "I saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines. Now get her for me to be my wife."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_3" data-id="JG14_3">His father and mother said to him, "Is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people? Are you going to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, for when I look at her, she pleases me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_4" data-id="JG14_4">But his father and his mother did not know that this matter came from Yahweh, for he desired to create a conflict with the Philistines (for at that time the Philistines were ruling Israel).</span>

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_5" data-id="JG14_5">Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and his mother, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah. And, look, there one of the young lions came up and was roaring at him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_6" data-id="JG14_6">Yahweh's Spirit suddenly came on him, and he tore the lion apart as easily as he would have torn apart a small goat, and he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_7" data-id="JG14_7">He went and spoke with the woman, and when he looked at her, she pleased Samson.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_9" data-id="JG14_9">He scraped up the honey in his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and his mother, he gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them he had taken the honey out of what was left of the lion's body.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_17" data-id="JG14_17">She cried during the seven days that their feast lasted. On the seventh day he told her the answer because she pressured him very much. She told the answer to the relatives of her people.</span>
