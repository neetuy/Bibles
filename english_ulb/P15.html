<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_1" data-id="P15_1">I am exhorting the elders among you, I, who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and am also one who will share in the glory that will be revealed:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_2" data-id="P15_2">Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God would have you serve—not for shameful profit but eagerly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_3" data-id="P15_3">Do not act as a master over the people who are in your care. Instead, be an example to the flock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_4" data-id="P15_4">Then when the Chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive an unfading crown of glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_5" data-id="P15_5">In the same way, you younger men, submit to the older men. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility and serve one another. For God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_6" data-id="P15_6">Therefore humble yourselves under God's mighty hand so that he may lift you up in due time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_7" data-id="P15_7">Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_8" data-id="P15_8">Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, is stalking around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_9" data-id="P15_9">Stand against him. Be strong in your faith. You know that your community of believers that is in the world is enduring the same sufferings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_10" data-id="P15_10">After you suffer for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will perfect you, establish you, and strengthen you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_11" data-id="P15_11">To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</span>
