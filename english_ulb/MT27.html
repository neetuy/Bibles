<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_1" data-id="MT27_1">Now when morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put him to death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_2" data-id="MT27_2">They bound him, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate the governor.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_3" data-id="MT27_3">Then when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_4" data-id="MT27_4">and said, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? See to that yourself."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_5" data-id="MT27_5">Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went out and hanged himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_6" data-id="MT27_6">The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put this into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_7" data-id="MT27_7">They discussed the matter together and with the money bought the potter's field in which to bury strangers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_8" data-id="MT27_8">For this reason that field has been called, "The Field of Blood" to this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_9" data-id="MT27_9">Then that which had been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_10" data-id="MT27_10">and they gave it for the potter's field, as the Lord had directed me."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_11" data-id="MT27_11">Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered him, "You say so."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_12" data-id="MT27_12">But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_13" data-id="MT27_13">Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear all the charges against you?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_14" data-id="MT27_14">But he did not answer even one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_15" data-id="MT27_15">Now at the feast it was the custom of the governor to release one prisoner chosen by the crowd.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_16" data-id="MT27_16">At that time they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_17" data-id="MT27_17">So when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Who do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_18" data-id="MT27_18">He knew that they had handed Jesus over to him because of envy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_19" data-id="MT27_19">While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him and said, "Have nothing to do with that innocent man. For I have suffered much today because of a dream I had about him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_20" data-id="MT27_20">Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas, and have Jesus killed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_21" data-id="MT27_21">The governor asked them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_22" data-id="MT27_22">Pilate said to them, "What should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all answered, "Crucify him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_23" data-id="MT27_23">Then he said, "Why, what crime has he done?" But they cried out even louder, "Crucify him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_24" data-id="MT27_24">So when Pilate saw that he could not do anything, but instead a riot was starting, he took water, washed his hands in front of the crowd, and said, "I am innocent of the blood of this innocent man. See to it yourselves."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_25" data-id="MT27_25">All the people said, "May his blood be on us and our children."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_26" data-id="MT27_26">Then he released Barabbas to them, but he scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_27" data-id="MT27_27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the government headquarters and gathered the whole company of soldiers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_28" data-id="MT27_28">They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_29" data-id="MT27_29">They made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and placed a staff in his right hand. They knelt down before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_30" data-id="MT27_30">They spat on him, and they took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_31" data-id="MT27_31">When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him and put his own garments on him, and led him away to crucify him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_32" data-id="MT27_32">As they came out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to go with them so that he might carry his cross.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_33" data-id="MT27_33">They came to a place called Golgotha, which means "The Place of a Skull."</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_34" data-id="MT27_34">They gave him wine to drink mixed with gall. But when he tasted it, he would not drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_35" data-id="MT27_35">When they had crucified him, they divided up his garments by casting lots,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_36" data-id="MT27_36">and they sat and kept guard over him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_37" data-id="MT27_37">Above his head they put the charge against him, which read "This is Jesus, the king of the Jews."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_38" data-id="MT27_38">Two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right of him and one on the left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_39" data-id="MT27_39">Those who passed by insulted him, shaking their heads</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_40" data-id="MT27_40">and saying, "You who were going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_41" data-id="MT27_41">In the same way the chief priests were mocking him, along with the scribes and elders, and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_42" data-id="MT27_42">"He saved others, but he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel. Let him come down off the cross, and then we will believe in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_43" data-id="MT27_43">He trusts in God, let God rescue him now, if God consents to release him. For he even said, 'I am the Son of God.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_44" data-id="MT27_44">In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also spoke insults to him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_45" data-id="MT27_45">Now from the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_46" data-id="MT27_46">About the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice and said, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_47" data-id="MT27_47">When some of those who were standing there heard it, they said, "He is calling for Elijah."</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_48" data-id="MT27_48">Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed staff, and gave it to him to drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_49" data-id="MT27_49">The rest of them said, "Leave him alone. Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_50" data-id="MT27_50">Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_51" data-id="MT27_51">Behold, the curtain of the temple was split in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth shook, and the rocks split apart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_52" data-id="MT27_52">The tombs were opened, and the bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_53" data-id="MT27_53">They came out of the tombs after his resurrection, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54 " data-id="bibleJsn">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_54" data-id="MT27_54">Now when the centurion and those who were watching Jesus saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they became very afraid and said, "Truly this was the Son of God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-55 " data-id="bibleJsn">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_55" data-id="MT27_55">Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him were there looking on from a distance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56 " data-id="bibleJsn">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_56" data-id="MT27_56">Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-57 " data-id="bibleJsn">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_57" data-id="MT27_57">When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-58 " data-id="bibleJsn">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_58" data-id="MT27_58">He approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59 " data-id="bibleJsn">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_59" data-id="MT27_59">Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-60 " data-id="bibleJsn">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_60" data-id="MT27_60">and laid it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb and went away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-61 " data-id="bibleJsn">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_61" data-id="MT27_61">Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-62 " data-id="bibleJsn">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_62" data-id="MT27_62">The next day, which was the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together with Pilate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-63 " data-id="bibleJsn">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_63" data-id="MT27_63">They said, "Sir, we remember that when that deceiver was alive, he said, 'After three days will I rise again.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-64 " data-id="bibleJsn">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_64" data-id="MT27_64">Therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, otherwise his disciples may come and steal him and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."</span>
<span class="v-num v-65 " data-id="bibleJsn">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_65" data-id="MT27_65">Pilate said to them, "Take a guard. Go and make it as secure as you can."</span>
<span class="v-num v-66 " data-id="bibleJsn">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_66" data-id="MT27_66">So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and placing the guard.</span>
