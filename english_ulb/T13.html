<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T13_2" data-id="T13_2">Therefore the overseer must be without reproach, a husband of one wife, moderate, sensible, orderly, hospitable, able to teach,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T13_3" data-id="T13_3">not addicted to wine, not a brawler, but instead, gentle, peaceful, not a lover of money.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T13_5" data-id="T13_5">For if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T13_6" data-id="T13_6">He must not be a new convert, so that he does not swell with pride and might not fall into condemnation of the devil.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T13_11" data-id="T13_11">Women in the same way should be dignified, not slanderers, moderate, and faithful in all things.</span>
