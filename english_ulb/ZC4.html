<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_1" data-id="ZC4_1">Then the angel who was talking with me turned and roused me like a man roused from his sleep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_2" data-id="ZC4_2">He said to me, "What do you see?" I said, "I see a lampstand made entirely of gold, with a bowl on its top. It has seven lamps on it and seven lamp wicks at the top of each lamp.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_3" data-id="ZC4_3">Two olive trees are by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on the left side."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_4" data-id="ZC4_4">So I spoke again to the angel who was talking with me. I said, "What do these things mean, my master?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_5" data-id="ZC4_5">The angel who was talking with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these things mean?" I said, "No, my master."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_6" data-id="ZC4_6">So he said to me, "This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel: Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, says Yahweh of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_7" data-id="ZC4_7">What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain, and he will bring out the top stone to shouts of 'Grace! Grace to it!'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_8" data-id="ZC4_8">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_9" data-id="ZC4_9">"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house and his hands will bring it to completion." Then you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_10" data-id="ZC4_10">Who has despised the day of small things? These people will rejoice and will see the plumb stone in the hand of Zerubbabel. (These seven lamps are the eyes of Yahweh that roam over the whole earth.)</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_11" data-id="ZC4_11">Then I asked the angel, "What are these two olive trees that stand on the left and the right of the lampstand?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_12" data-id="ZC4_12">Once more I asked him, "What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that have golden oil pouring out of them?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_13" data-id="ZC4_13">Then he said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" I said, "No, my master."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC4_14" data-id="ZC4_14">So he said, "These are the sons of fresh olive oil who stand before the Lord of all the earth."</span>
