<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_2" data-id="NU18_2">As for your fellow members of the tribe of Levi, your ancestors' tribe, you must bring them with you so they may join you and help you when you and your sons serve in front of the tent of the covenant decrees.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_3" data-id="NU18_3">They must serve you and the whole tent. However, they must not come near to anything in the holy place or connected with the altar, or they and also you will die.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_16" data-id="NU18_16">Those that are to be bought back by the people must be bought back after becoming one month old.

<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_17" data-id="NU18_17">But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat—you must not buy back these animals; they are set apart to me. You must sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_18" data-id="NU18_18">Their meat will be yours. Like the raised breast and the right thigh, their meat will be yours.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_21" data-id="NU18_21">To the descendants of Levi, look, I have given all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the service that they provide in working at the tent of meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_22" data-id="NU18_22">From now on the people of Israel must not come near the tent of meeting, or they will be responsible for this sin and die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_23" data-id="NU18_23">The Levites must do the work connected to the tent of meeting. They will be responsible for any sin regarding it. This will be a permanent law throughout your people's generations. Among the people of Israel they must have no inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_24" data-id="NU18_24">For the tithes of the people of Israel, which they offer as a contribution to me—it is these that I have given to the Levites as their inheritance. That is why I said to them, 'They must have no inheritance among the people of Israel.'"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_25" data-id="NU18_25">Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_26" data-id="NU18_26">"You must speak to the Levites and say to them, 'When you receive from the people of Israel the tenth that I have given to you from them for your inheritance, you will present a contribution from it to Yahweh, a tenth of the tithe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_27" data-id="NU18_27">Your contribution must be considered by you as if it were a tenth of the grain from the threshing floor or of the production from the winepress.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_28" data-id="NU18_28">So you also must make a contribution to Yahweh from all the tithes that you receive from the people of Israel. From them you must give his contribution to Aaron the priest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_29" data-id="NU18_29">Out of all the gifts you receive, you must make every contribution to Yahweh. You must do this from all the best and the holiest things that have been given to you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_30" data-id="NU18_30">Therefore you must say to them, 'When you present the best of it, then it must be credited to the Levites as the product from the threshing floor and the winepress.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_31" data-id="NU18_31">You may eat the rest of your gifts in any place, you and your families, because it is your pay in return for your work in the tent of meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_32" data-id="NU18_32">You will not incur any guilt by eating and drinking it, if you have presented to Yahweh the best of what you have received. But you must not profane the holy offerings of the people of Israel, or you will die.'"</span>
