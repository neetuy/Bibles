<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_7" data-id="K18_7">For the cherubim spread out their wings to the place of the ark, and they covered the ark and the poles by which it was carried.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_8" data-id="K18_8">The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inner room, but they could not be seen from outside. They are there to this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_9" data-id="K18_9">There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses had put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the people of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt.</span>

<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_49" data-id="K18_49">Then from heaven, the place where you live, listen to their prayer and their request for help, and you will make matters right for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_50" data-id="K18_50">Forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions that they have committed against you, and make them objects of compassion before their conquerors, and cause their conquerors to have compassion on them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_51" data-id="K18_51">They are your people whom you have chosen, whom you rescued out of Egypt as if from the middle of a furnace where iron is forged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_52" data-id="K18_52">May your eyes be open to the request of your servant and to the requests of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_53" data-id="K18_53">For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to belong to you and receive your promises, just as you explained by Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord Yahweh."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-54 " data-id="bibleJsn">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_54" data-id="K18_54">So it was that when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and request to Yahweh, he arose from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread out toward the heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55 " data-id="bibleJsn">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_55" data-id="K18_55">He stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-56 " data-id="bibleJsn">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_56" data-id="K18_56">"May Yahweh be praised, who has given rest to his people Israel, keeping all his promises. Not one word has failed out of all Yahweh's good promises that he made with Moses his servant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57 " data-id="bibleJsn">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_57" data-id="K18_57">May Yahweh our God be with us, as he was with our ancestors. May he never leave us or forsake us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-58 " data-id="bibleJsn">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_58" data-id="K18_58">that he may incline our hearts to him, to live in all his ways and keep his commandments and his regulations and his statutes, which he commanded our fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59 " data-id="bibleJsn">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_59" data-id="K18_59">Let these words I have spoken, by which I have made request before Yahweh, be near Yahweh our God day and night, so that he may help the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel, as every day will require;</span>
<span class="v-num v-60 " data-id="bibleJsn">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_60" data-id="K18_60">that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God, and there is no other God!</span>
<span class="v-num v-61 " data-id="bibleJsn">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_61" data-id="K18_61">Therefore let your heart be true to Yahweh our God, to walk in his statutes and keep his commandments, as on this day."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-62 " data-id="bibleJsn">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_62" data-id="K18_62">So the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-63 " data-id="bibleJsn">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_63" data-id="K18_63">Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to Yahweh: twenty-two thousand oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-64 " data-id="bibleJsn">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_64" data-id="K18_64">The same day the king set apart the middle of the courtyard in front of the temple of Yahweh, for there he offered the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too small to receive the burnt offering, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-65 " data-id="bibleJsn">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_65" data-id="K18_65">So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from Lebo Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God for seven days and also for another seven days, a total of fourteen days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-66 " data-id="bibleJsn">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_66" data-id="K18_66">On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their homes with joyful and glad hearts for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David, his servant, and to Israel, his people.</span>
