<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_2" data-id="LK3_2">during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas—the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_3" data-id="LK3_3">He went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_4" data-id="LK3_4">As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_7" data-id="LK3_7">So John said to the crowds who were coming out to be baptized by him, "You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to run away from the wrath that is coming?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_8" data-id="LK3_8">Therefore, produce fruits that are worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_9" data-id="LK3_9">Even now the ax is set against the root of the trees. So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_10" data-id="LK3_10">Then the crowds kept asking him, saying, "What then are we to do?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_11" data-id="LK3_11">He answered and said to them, "If someone has two tunics, he should share it with a person who has none, and the one having food should do the same."</span>
