<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_1" data-id="JN5_1">After this there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_2" data-id="JN5_2">Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which in Hebrew is called Bethesda, and it has five roofed porches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_3" data-id="JN5_3">A large number of people who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed were lying there. <span class="note" id="footnote-262"><a href="#note-262" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_4" data-id="JN5_4"> <span class="note" id="footnote-263"><a href="#note-263" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_5" data-id="JN5_5">A certain man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_6" data-id="JN5_6">When Jesus saw him lying there, and after he realized that he had been there a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to be healthy?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_7" data-id="JN5_7">The sick man replied, "Sir, I do not have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. When I come, another steps down before me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_8" data-id="JN5_8">Jesus said to him, "Get up, take up your bed, and walk."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_9" data-id="JN5_9">Immediately the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN5_9" data-id="JN5_9">Now that day was a Sabbath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_10" data-id="JN5_10">So the Jews said to him who was healed, "It is the Sabbath and you are not permitted to carry your mat."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_11" data-id="JN5_11">He replied, "He who made me healthy said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_12" data-id="JN5_12">They asked him, "Who is the man that said to you, 'Pick it up and walk'?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_13" data-id="JN5_13">However, the one who was healed did not know who it was because Jesus had gone away secretly, for there was a crowd in the place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_14" data-id="JN5_14">Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, "See, you have become healthy! Do not sin anymore, so that something worse will not happen to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_15" data-id="JN5_15">The man went away and reported to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him healthy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_16" data-id="JN5_16">Now because of these things the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the Sabbath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_17" data-id="JN5_17">Jesus replied to them, "My Father is working even now, and I, too, am working."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_18" data-id="JN5_18">Because of this, the Jews sought even more to kill him because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_19" data-id="JN5_19">Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, the Son can do nothing of himself, except only what he sees the Father doing, for whatever the Father is doing, the Son does these things also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_20" data-id="JN5_20">For the Father loves the Son and he shows him everything that he himself does, and he will show him greater things than these so that you will be amazed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_21" data-id="JN5_21">For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_22" data-id="JN5_22">For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_23" data-id="JN5_23">so that everyone will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_24" data-id="JN5_24">Truly, truly, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned, but he has passed from death to life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_25" data-id="JN5_25">Truly, truly, I tell you the time is coming, and is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_26" data-id="JN5_26">For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has also given to the Son so that he has life in himself,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_27" data-id="JN5_27">and the Father has given the Son authority to carry out judgment because he is the Son of Man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_28" data-id="JN5_28">Do not be amazed at this, for there is a time coming in which everyone who is in the tombs will hear his voice</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_29" data-id="JN5_29">and will come out. Those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_30" data-id="JN5_30">I can do nothing from myself. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I am not seeking my own will but the will of him who sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_31" data-id="JN5_31">If I should testify about myself, my testimony would not be true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_32" data-id="JN5_32">There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony that he gives about me is true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_33" data-id="JN5_33">You have sent to John, and he has testified the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_34" data-id="JN5_34">But the testimony that I receive is not from man. I say these things that you might be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_35" data-id="JN5_35">John was a lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to rejoice in his light for a while.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_36" data-id="JN5_36">Yet the testimony that I have is greater than that of John, for the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me that the Father has sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_37" data-id="JN5_37">The Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You have neither heard his voice nor seen his form at any time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_38" data-id="JN5_38">You do not have his word remaining in you, for you are not believing in the one whom he has sent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_39" data-id="JN5_39">You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life, and these same scriptures testify about me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_40" data-id="JN5_40">and you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_41" data-id="JN5_41">I do not receive praise from men,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_42" data-id="JN5_42">but I know that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_43" data-id="JN5_43">I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another should come in his own name, you would receive him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_44" data-id="JN5_44">How can you believe, you who accept praise from one another but are not seeking the praise that comes from the only God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_45" data-id="JN5_45">Do not think that I myself will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_46" data-id="JN5_46">If you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_47" data-id="JN5_47">If you do not believe his writings, how are you going to believe my words?"</span>
