<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU5_7" data-id="NU5_7">Then he must confess the sin that he has done. He must completely pay back the price of his guilt and add to the price one-fifth more. He must give this to the one he has wronged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU5_8" data-id="NU5_8">But if the wronged person has no close relative to receive the payment, he must pay the price for his guilt to me through a priest, along with a ram to atone for himself.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU5_15" data-id="NU5_15">In such cases, the man must bring his wife to the priest. The husband must take an offering required on her behalf, a tenth of an ephah of barley flour.
