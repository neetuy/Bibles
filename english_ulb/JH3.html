<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_1" data-id="JH3_1">The word of Yahweh came to Jonah a second time, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_2" data-id="JH3_2">"Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I command you to give."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_3" data-id="JH3_3">So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh, according to the word of Yahweh. Now Nineveh was a very large city, one of three days' journey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_4" data-id="JH3_4">Jonah began to enter the city and after a day's journey he called out and said, "In forty days Nineveh will be overthrown."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_5" data-id="JH3_5">The people of Nineveh believed God and they proclaimed a fast. They all put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them down to the least of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_6" data-id="JH3_6">Soon the news reached the king of Nineveh. He rose up from his throne, took off his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_7" data-id="JH3_7">He sent out a proclamation that said, "In Nineveh, by the authority of the king and his nobles, let neither man nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not eat, nor drink water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_8" data-id="JH3_8">But let both man and animal be covered with sackcloth and let them cry out loudly to God. Let every one turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_9" data-id="JH3_9">Who knows? God may relent and change his mind and turn away from his fierce anger so that we do not perish."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_10" data-id="JH3_10">God saw what they did, that they turned from their evil ways. So then God changed his mind about the punishment that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.</span>
