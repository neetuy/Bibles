<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC21_4" data-id="AC21_4">After we found the disciples, we stayed there seven days. Through the Spirit they kept urging Paul not to go to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC21_28" data-id="AC21_28">They were shouting, "Men of Israel, help us.

<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC21_29" data-id="AC21_29">For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC21_30" data-id="AC21_30">All the city was excited, and the people ran together and laid hold of Paul. They dragged him out of the temple, and the doors were immediately shut.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC21_31" data-id="AC21_31">As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the chief captain of the guard that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</span>
