<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU30_5" data-id="NU30_5">But if her father overrules her when he hears about it, none of her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will remain in force; Yahweh will release her because her father has forbidden her.</span>
