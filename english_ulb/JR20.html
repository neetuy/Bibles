<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_4" data-id="JR20_4">For Yahweh says this, 'Look, I will make you an object of horror, you and all of your loved ones, for they will fall by the sword of their enemies and your eyes will see it. I will give all of Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He will make them captives in Babylon or attack them with the sword.</span>
