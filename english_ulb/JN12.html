<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_1" data-id="JN12_1">Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead, was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_2" data-id="JN12_2">So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of those who was lying down at the table with Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_3" data-id="JN12_3">Then Mary took a litra of perfume made of very precious pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_4" data-id="JN12_4">Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who would betray him, said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_5" data-id="JN12_5">"Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_6" data-id="JN12_6">Now he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. He had the moneybag and would steal from what was put in it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_7" data-id="JN12_7">Jesus said, "Allow her to keep what she has for the day of my burial.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_8" data-id="JN12_8">You will always have the poor with you. But you will not always have me."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_9" data-id="JN12_9">Now a large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, and they came, not only for Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_10" data-id="JN12_10">The chief priests conspired together so that they might also put Lazarus to death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_11" data-id="JN12_11">for it was because of him that many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_12" data-id="JN12_12">On the next day a great crowd came to the festival. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_13" data-id="JN12_13">they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_14" data-id="JN12_14">Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it was written,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_15" data-id="JN12_15">"Do not fear, daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, sitting on the colt of a donkey."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_16" data-id="JN12_16">His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_17" data-id="JN12_17">Now the crowd testified that they had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_18" data-id="JN12_18">It was also for this reason that the crowd went out to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_19" data-id="JN12_19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "Look, you can do nothing; see, the world has gone after him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_20" data-id="JN12_20">Now certain Greeks were among those who were going up to worship at the festival.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_21" data-id="JN12_21">These went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we want to see Jesus."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_22" data-id="JN12_22">Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip, and they told Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_23" data-id="JN12_23">Jesus answered them and said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_24" data-id="JN12_24">Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone; but if it dies, it will bear much fruit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_25" data-id="JN12_25">He who loves his life will lose it; but he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_26" data-id="JN12_26">If anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_27" data-id="JN12_27">Now my soul is troubled and what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_28" data-id="JN12_28">Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven and said, "I have glorified it and I will glorify it again."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_29" data-id="JN12_29">Then the crowd that stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_30" data-id="JN12_30">Jesus answered and said, "This voice did not come for me, but for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_31" data-id="JN12_31">Now is the judgment of this world: Now will the ruler of this world be thrown out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_32" data-id="JN12_32">When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_33" data-id="JN12_33">He said this to indicate what kind of death he would die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_34" data-id="JN12_34">The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the law that the Christ will stay forever. How can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_35" data-id="JN12_35">Jesus then said to them, "The light will still be with you for a short amount of time. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_36" data-id="JN12_36">While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may be sons of light."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN12_36" data-id="JN12_36">Jesus said these things and then departed and hid from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_37" data-id="JN12_37">Although Jesus had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_38" data-id="JN12_38">so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled, in which he said:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN12_38" data-id="JN12_38">"Lord, who has believed our report,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN12_38" data-id="JN12_38">and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_39" data-id="JN12_39">For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah had also said,</span>

<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_40" data-id="JN12_40">"He has blinded their eyes, and he has hardened their hearts;</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN12_40" data-id="JN12_40">otherwise they would see with their eyes and understand with their hearts,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN12_40" data-id="JN12_40">and turn,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN12_40" data-id="JN12_40">and I would heal them."</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_41" data-id="JN12_41">Isaiah said these things because he saw the glory of Jesus and spoke of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_42" data-id="JN12_42">But despite that, many of the rulers believed in Jesus; but because of the Pharisees, they did not admit it so that they would not be banned from the synagogue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_43" data-id="JN12_43">They loved the praise that comes from people more than the praise that comes from God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_44" data-id="JN12_44">Jesus cried out and said, "The one who believes in me, believes not only in me but also in him who sent me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_45" data-id="JN12_45">and the one who sees me sees him who sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_46" data-id="JN12_46">I have come as a light into the world, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_47" data-id="JN12_47">If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_48" data-id="JN12_48">The one who rejects me and who does not receive my words, has one who judges him. The word I have spoken will judge him on the last day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_49" data-id="JN12_49">For I did not speak for myself, but it is the Father who sent me, who has given me the command about what to say and what to speak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_50" data-id="JN12_50">I know that his command is eternal life, so that is what I say—just as the Father has spoken to me, so I speak."</span>
