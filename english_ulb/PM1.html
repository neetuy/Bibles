<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_1" data-id="PM1_1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and the brother Timothy to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_2" data-id="PM1_2">and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your home.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_3" data-id="PM1_3">May grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_4" data-id="PM1_4">I always thank my God. I mention you in my prayers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_5" data-id="PM1_5">I have heard of the love and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and for all the believers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_6" data-id="PM1_6">I pray that the fellowship of your faith may be effective for the knowledge of everything good that is among us in Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_7" data-id="PM1_7">For I have had much joy and comfort because of your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_8" data-id="PM1_8">Therefore, although I have all the boldness in Christ to command you to do what you should do,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_9" data-id="PM1_9">yet because of love, I appeal to you instead—I, Paul, an old man, and now a prisoner for Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_10" data-id="PM1_10">I am asking you concerning my child Onesimus, whom I have fathered in my chains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_11" data-id="PM1_11">For he once was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_12" data-id="PM1_12">I have sent him back to you, he who is my very heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_13" data-id="PM1_13">I wish I could have kept him with me, so he could serve me for you, while I am in chains for the sake of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_14" data-id="PM1_14">But I did not want to do anything without your consent. I did not want your good deed to be from necessity but from good will.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_15" data-id="PM1_15">Perhaps for this he was separated from you for a time, so that you might have him back forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_16" data-id="PM1_16">No longer would he be a slave, but better than a slave, a beloved brother. He is beloved especially to me, and much more so to you, in both the flesh and in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_17" data-id="PM1_17">So if you have me as a partner, receive him as me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_18" data-id="PM1_18">If he has wronged you or owes you anything, charge that to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_19" data-id="PM1_19">I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I myself will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your own self!</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_20" data-id="PM1_20">Yes, brother, do me a favor in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_21" data-id="PM1_21">Confident about your obedience, I am writing to you. I know that you will do even more than I ask.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_22" data-id="PM1_22">At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_23" data-id="PM1_23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_24" data-id="PM1_24">So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</span>
