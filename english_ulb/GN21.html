<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_27" data-id="GN21_27">So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_28" data-id="GN21_28">Then Abraham set seven female lambs of the flock by themselves.</span>

<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_30" data-id="GN21_30">He replied, "These seven female lambs you will receive from my hand, so that it may be a witness for me, that I dug this well."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_31" data-id="GN21_31">So he called that place Beersheba, because there they both swore an oath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_32" data-id="GN21_32">They made a covenant at Beersheba, and then Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, returned to the land of the Philistines.</span>
