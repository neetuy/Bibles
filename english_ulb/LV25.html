<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV25_31" data-id="LV25_31">But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them will be considered as the field of the land. They may be redeemed, and they must be returned during the year of Jubilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV25_32" data-id="LV25_32">However, the houses owned by the Levites in their cities may be redeemed at any time.</span>
