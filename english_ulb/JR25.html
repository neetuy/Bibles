<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_1" data-id="JR25_1">This is the word that came to Jeremiah about all the people of Judah. It came in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah. That was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_2" data-id="JR25_2">Jeremiah the prophet proclaimed this to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_3" data-id="JR25_3">He said, "For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah until this day, Yahweh's words have been coming to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_4" data-id="JR25_4">Yahweh sent out all his servants the prophets to you again and again, but you have not listened or paid any attention.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_5" data-id="JR25_5">These prophets said, 'Let each man turn from his wicked way and the corruption of his practices and return to the land that Yahweh gave in ancient times to your ancestors and to you, as a permanent gift.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_6" data-id="JR25_6">So do not walk after other gods to worship them or bow down to them, and do not provoke him with the work of your hands so that he does you harm.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_7" data-id="JR25_7">But you have not listened to me—this is Yahweh's declaration—so you have provoked me with the work of your hands to do harm to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_8" data-id="JR25_8">So Yahweh of hosts says this, 'Because you did not listen to my words,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_9" data-id="JR25_9">see, I am about to send out a command to gather all the peoples of the north—this is Yahweh's declaration—with Nebuchadnezzar my servant, king of Babylon, and bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all the nations around you. For I will set them apart for destruction. I will turn them into a horror, an object for hissing, and an unending desolation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_10" data-id="JR25_10">I will put an end to the sound of joy and sound of gladness, the sound of the groom and the sound of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_11" data-id="JR25_11">Then all of this land will become a desolation and a horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_12" data-id="JR25_12">Then it will happen when seventy years have been completed, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans—this is Yahweh's declaration—for their iniquity and make it an unending desolation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_13" data-id="JR25_13">Then I will carry out against that land all the words that I had spoken, and everything written in this book that Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_14" data-id="JR25_14">For also many other nations and great kings will make slaves out of these nations. I will repay them for their deeds and the works of their hands.'"</span>
