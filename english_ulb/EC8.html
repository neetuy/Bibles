This also is uselessness. <span class="note" id="footnote-119"><a href="#note-119" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_11" data-id="EC8_11">When a sentence against an evil crime is not executed quickly, it entices the hearts of human beings to do evil.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_15" data-id="EC8_15">So I recommend happiness, because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and drink and to be happy. It is happiness that will accompany him in his labor for all the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_16" data-id="EC8_16">When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to understand the work that is done on the earth, work often done without sleep for the eyes at night or in the day,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_17" data-id="EC8_17">then I considered all of God's deeds, and that man cannot understand the work that is done under the sun. No matter how much a man labors to find the answers, he will not find them. Even though a wise man might believe he knows, he really does not.</span>
