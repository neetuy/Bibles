<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_1" data-id="LV16_1">Yahweh spoke to Mosesâ€”this was after the death of Aaron's two sons, when they had gone near to Yahweh and then died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_2" data-id="LV16_2">Yahweh said to Moses, "Speak to Aaron your brother and tell him not to come at just any time into the most holy place inside the curtain, before the atonement lid that is on the ark. If he does, he will die, because I appear in the cloud over the atonement lid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_3" data-id="LV16_3">So here is how Aaron must come into the most holy place. He must enter with a young bull as a sin offering, and a ram as a burnt offering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_4" data-id="LV16_4">He must put on the holy linen tunic, and he must put the linen undergarments on himself, and he must wear the linen sash and linen turban. These are the holy garments. He must bathe his body in water and then dress himself with these clothes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_5" data-id="LV16_5">He must take from the assembly of the people of Israel two male goats as a sin offering and one ram as a burnt offering.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_6" data-id="LV16_6">Then Aaron must present the bull as the sin offering, which will be for himself, to make atonement for himself and his family.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_7" data-id="LV16_7">Then he must take the two goats and set them before Yahweh at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_8" data-id="LV16_8">Then Aaron must cast lots for the two goats, one lot for Yahweh, and the other lot for the scapegoat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_9" data-id="LV16_9">Aaron must then present the goat on which the lot fell for Yahweh, and offer that goat as a sin offering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_10" data-id="LV16_10">But the goat on which the lot fell for the scapegoat must be brought alive before Yahweh, to make atonement by sending him away as a scapegoat into the wilderness.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_11" data-id="LV16_11">Then Aaron must present the bull for the sin offering, which will be for himself. He must make atonement for himself and for his family, so he must kill the bull as a sin offering for himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_12" data-id="LV16_12">Aaron must take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Yahweh, with his hands full of finely ground sweet incense, and bring these things inside the curtain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_13" data-id="LV16_13">There he must put the incense on the fire before Yahweh so that the cloud from the incense may cover the atonement lid over the covenant decrees. He must do this so he will not die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_14" data-id="LV16_14">Then he must take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the atonement lid.

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_15" data-id="LV16_15">Then he must kill the goat for the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the curtain.

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_16" data-id="LV16_16">He must make atonement for the holy place because of the unclean actions of the people of Israel, and because of their rebellion and all their sins.

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_18" data-id="LV16_18">He must go out to the altar that is before Yahweh and make atonement for it, and he must take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it on the horns of the altar all around.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_19" data-id="LV16_19">He must sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and set it apart to Yahweh, away from the unclean actions of the people of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_21" data-id="LV16_21">Aaron must lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over him all the wickedness of the people of Israel, all their rebellion, and all their sins. Then he must put that sinfulness on the head of the goat and send the goat away in the care of a man who is ready to lead the goat into the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_22" data-id="LV16_22">The goat must carry on himself all the people's wickedness to a solitary place. There in the wilderness, the man must let the goat go free.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_23" data-id="LV16_23">Then Aaron must go back into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments that he had put on before going into the most holy place, and he must leave those garments there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_24" data-id="LV16_24">He must bathe his body in water in a holy place, and put on his normal garments; then he must go out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering for the people, and in this way make atonement for himself and for the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_25" data-id="LV16_25">He must burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_26" data-id="LV16_26">The man who let the scapegoat go free must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; after that, he may come back into the camp.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_27" data-id="LV16_27">The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, must be carried outside the camp.

<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_28" data-id="LV16_28">The man who burns those parts must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; after that, he may come back into the camp.</span>

<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_30" data-id="LV16_30">This is because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you from all your sins so you will be clean before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV16_31" data-id="LV16_31">It is a solemn Sabbath of rest for you, and you must humble yourselves and do no work. This will always be a statute among you.</span>
