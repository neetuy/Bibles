<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_2" data-id="EX34_2">Be ready by morning and come up Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the mountain top.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_3" data-id="EX34_3">No one is to come up with you. Do not let anyone else be seen anywhere on the mountain. No flocks or herds are even to graze in front of the mountain."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_4" data-id="EX34_4">So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and he got up early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had instructed him. Moses carried the tablets of stone in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_5" data-id="EX34_5">Yahweh came down in the cloud and stood with Moses there, and he pronounced the name "Yahweh."</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_7" data-id="EX34_7">keeping covenant faithfulness for thousands of generations, forgiving iniquities, transgressions, and sins. But he will by no means clear the guilty. He will bring the punishment for the fathers' sin on their children and on their children's children, as far as the third and fourth generations."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_8" data-id="EX34_8">Moses quickly bowed his head to the ground and worshiped.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_9" data-id="EX34_9">Then he said, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, my Lord, please go among us, for this people is stubborn. Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as your inheritance."</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_13" data-id="EX34_13">Instead, you must break down their altars, smash their stone pillars, and cut down their Asherah poles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_14" data-id="EX34_14">For you must worship no other god, for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_15" data-id="EX34_15">So be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for they prostitute themselves to their gods, and they sacrifice to their gods. Then one of them will invite you and you will eat some of his sacrifice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_16" data-id="EX34_16">and then you will even take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods, and they will make your sons prostitute themselves to their gods.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_25" data-id="EX34_25">You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice with any yeast, nor may any meat from the sacrifice at the Festival of the Passover be left over to the morning.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_27" data-id="EX34_27">Yahweh said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_29" data-id="EX34_29">When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant decrees in his hand, he did not know that the skin of his face had become radiant while speaking with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_30" data-id="EX34_30">When Aaron and the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_31" data-id="EX34_31">But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community came up to him. Then Moses spoke with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_32" data-id="EX34_32">After this, all the people of Israel came up to Moses, and he told them all the commands that Yahweh had given him on Mount Sinai.</span>
