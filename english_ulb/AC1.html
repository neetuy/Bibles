<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_1" data-id="AC1_1">The former book I wrote, Theophilus, told all that Jesus began to do and to teach,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_2" data-id="AC1_2">until the day that he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_3" data-id="AC1_3">After his suffering, he presented himself alive to them with many convincing proofs. For forty days he appeared to them, and he spoke about the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_4" data-id="AC1_4">When he was meeting together with them, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, about which, he said, "You heard from me</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_5" data-id="AC1_5">that John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit in a few days."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_6" data-id="AC1_6">When they were assembled together they asked him, "Lord, is this the time you will restore the kingdom to Israel?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_7" data-id="AC1_7">He said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father has determined by his own authority.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_8" data-id="AC1_8">But you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_9" data-id="AC1_9">When the Lord Jesus had said these things, as they were looking up, he was raised up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_10" data-id="AC1_10">While they were looking intensely to heaven as he went, suddenly, two men stood by them in white clothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_11" data-id="AC1_11">They said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into heaven? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, will return in the same manner as you saw him going into heaven."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_12" data-id="AC1_12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near to Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_13" data-id="AC1_13">When they arrived, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were staying. They were Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_14" data-id="AC1_14">They were all united as one, as they diligently continued in prayer. Included were the women, Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_15" data-id="AC1_15">In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers, about 120 people, and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_16" data-id="AC1_16">"Brothers, it was necessary that the scripture should be fulfilled, that the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who guided the ones who arrested Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_17" data-id="AC1_17">For he was one of us and received his share of the benefits of this ministry."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_18" data-id="AC1_18">(Now this man bought a field with the earnings he received for his wickedness, and there he fell headfirst, and his body burst open, and all his intestines poured out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_19" data-id="AC1_19">All those living in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language "Akeldama," that is, "Field of Blood.")</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_20" data-id="AC1_20">"For it is written in the Book of Psalms,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC1_20" data-id="AC1_20">'Let his field be made desolate,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC1_20" data-id="AC1_20">and do not let even one person live there';</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC1_20" data-id="AC1_20">'Let someone else take his position of leadership.'</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_21" data-id="AC1_21">It is necessary, therefore, that one of the men who accompanied us all the time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_22" data-id="AC1_22">beginning from the baptism of John to the day that he was taken up from us, must be a witness with us of his resurrection."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_23" data-id="AC1_23">They put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also named Justus, and Matthias.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_24" data-id="AC1_24">They prayed and said, "You, Lord, know the hearts of all people, so reveal which of these two is the one whom you have chosen</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_25" data-id="AC1_25">to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned away to go to his own place."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_26" data-id="AC1_26">They cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span>
