<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_1" data-id="RM14_1">Receive anyone who is weak in faith, without giving judgment about arguments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_2" data-id="RM14_2">One person has faith to eat anything, another who is weak eats only vegetables.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_3" data-id="RM14_3">May the one who eats everything not despise the one who does not; and may the one who does not eat everything not judge the other who eats everything. For God has accepted him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_4" data-id="RM14_4">Who are you, you who judge a servant belonging to someone else? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. But he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_5" data-id="RM14_5">One person values one day above another. Another values every day equally. Let each person be convinced in his own mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_6" data-id="RM14_6">He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord; and he who eats, eats for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God. He who does not eat, refrains from eating for the Lord, he also gives thanks to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_7" data-id="RM14_7">For none of us lives for himself, and none dies for himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_8" data-id="RM14_8">For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. Then whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_9" data-id="RM14_9">For to this purpose Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and those who are living.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_10" data-id="RM14_10">But you, why do you judge your brother? And you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_11" data-id="RM14_11">For it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM14_11" data-id="RM14_11">"As I live," says the Lord, "to me every knee will bend,</div>

<span class="v RM14_11" data-id="RM14_11">and every tongue will give praise to God."</div>

<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_12" data-id="RM14_12">So then, each one of us will give an account of himself to God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_13" data-id="RM14_13">Therefore, let us no longer judge one another, but instead decide this, that no one will place a stumbling block or a snare for his brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_14" data-id="RM14_14">I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean by itself. Only for him who considers anything to be unclean, for him it is unclean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_15" data-id="RM14_15">If because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food one for whom Christ died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_16" data-id="RM14_16">So do not allow what you consider to be good to be spoken of as evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_17" data-id="RM14_17">For the kingdom of God is not about food and drink, but about righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_18" data-id="RM14_18">For the one who serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and approved by people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_19" data-id="RM14_19">So then, let us pursue the things of peace and the things that build up one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_20" data-id="RM14_20">Do not destroy the work of God because of food. All things are indeed clean, but it is evil for that person who eats and causes him to stumble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_21" data-id="RM14_21">It is good not to eat meat, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother takes offense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_22" data-id="RM14_22">The faith you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_23" data-id="RM14_23">He who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not from faith. And whatever is not from faith is sin.</span>
