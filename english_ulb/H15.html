<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_2" data-id="H15_2">For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the Lord is coming like a thief in the night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_3" data-id="H15_3">When they say, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction will come on them. It will be like birth pains in a pregnant woman. They will in no way escape.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_4" data-id="H15_4">But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that the day would overtake you like a thief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_5" data-id="H15_5">For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We are not sons of the night or the darkness.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_7" data-id="H15_7">For those who sleep do so at night, and those who get drunk do so at night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_8" data-id="H15_8">But since we belong to the day, we must stay sober and put on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation for our helmet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_9" data-id="H15_9">For God did not appoint us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_10" data-id="H15_10">It is he who died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_15" data-id="H15_15">See that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone. Instead, pursue what is good for one another and for all.</span>
