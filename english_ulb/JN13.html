<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_1" data-id="JN13_1">Now it was before the Festival of the Passover. Jesus knew that his hour had come to go out of this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_2" data-id="JN13_2">Now the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot son of Simon, to betray Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_3" data-id="JN13_3">He knew that the Father had given everything over into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_4" data-id="JN13_4">He got up from dinner and took off his outer clothing. Then he took a towel and wrapped it around himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_5" data-id="JN13_5">Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and dry them with the towel that he had put around himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_6" data-id="JN13_6">He came to Simon Peter, and Peter said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_7" data-id="JN13_7">Jesus answered and said to him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand this later."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_8" data-id="JN13_8">Peter said to him, "You will never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no share with me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_9" data-id="JN13_9">Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, do not only wash my feet, but also my hands and my head."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_10" data-id="JN13_10">Jesus said to him, "He who is bathed has no need, except to wash his feet, but he is completely clean; you are clean, but not everyone."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_11" data-id="JN13_11">(For Jesus knew who would betray him; that is why he said, "Not all of you are clean.")</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_12" data-id="JN13_12">So when Jesus had washed their feet and taken his garments and sat down again, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done for you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_13" data-id="JN13_13">You call me 'teacher' and 'Lord,' and you are speaking correctly, because so I am.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_14" data-id="JN13_14">If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you should also wash the feet of one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_15" data-id="JN13_15">For I have given you an example so that you should also do just as I did for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_16" data-id="JN13_16">Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is a messenger greater than he who sent him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_17" data-id="JN13_17">If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_18" data-id="JN13_18">I am not speaking about all of you; I know those whom I have chosenâ€”but this so that the scripture will be fulfilled: 'He who eats my bread lifted up his heel against me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_19" data-id="JN13_19">I tell you this now before it happens so that when it happens, you may believe that I AM.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_20" data-id="JN13_20">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I sent, receives me, and he who receives me, receives him who sent me."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_21" data-id="JN13_21">When Jesus said this, he was troubled in spirit. He testified and said, "Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_22" data-id="JN13_22">The disciples looked at each other, wondering of whom he was speaking.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_23" data-id="JN13_23">One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was lying down at the table against Jesus' side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_24" data-id="JN13_24">Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him who he is speaking about."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_25" data-id="JN13_25">So he leaned back against the side of Jesus and said to him, "Lord, who is it?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_26" data-id="JN13_26">Then Jesus answered, "It is the one for whom I will dip the piece of bread and give it him." So when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_27" data-id="JN13_27">Then after the bread, Satan entered into him, so Jesus said to him, "What you are doing, do it quickly."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_28" data-id="JN13_28">Now no one who was lying down at the table knew why he said this to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_29" data-id="JN13_29">Some thought that, since Judas had the moneybag, Jesus said to him, "Buy what we need to have for the festival," or that he should give something to the poor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_30" data-id="JN13_30">After Judas received the bread, he went out immediately. It was night.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_31" data-id="JN13_31">When Judas was gone, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_32" data-id="JN13_32">God will glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_33" data-id="JN13_33">Little children, I am with you for still a short amount of time. You will look for me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.' Now I also say this to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_34" data-id="JN13_34">I am giving you a new commandment, that you should love one another; as I have loved you, so also you should love one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_35" data-id="JN13_35">By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_36" data-id="JN13_36">Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later."</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_37" data-id="JN13_37">Peter said to him, "Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_38" data-id="JN13_38">Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow before you have denied me three times."</span>
