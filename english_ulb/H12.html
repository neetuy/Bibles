<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_1" data-id="H12_1">For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not useless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_2" data-id="H12_2">You know that we previously suffered and were shamefully treated at Philippi. We were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much struggling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_3" data-id="H12_3">For our exhortation was not from error, nor from impurity, nor from deceit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_4" data-id="H12_4">Instead, just as we have been approved by God to be trusted with the gospel, so we speak. We speak, not to please men, but to please God. He is the one who examines our hearts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_5" data-id="H12_5">For we never used words of flattery, as you know, nor as an excuse to cover up greed— God is our witness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_6" data-id="H12_6">Nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others. We could have claimed privileges as apostles of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_7" data-id="H12_7">Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children. <span class="note" id="footnote-308"><a href="#note-308" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_8" data-id="H12_8">In this way we had affection for you. We were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives. For you had become very dear to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_9" data-id="H12_9">For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil. Night and day we were working so that we might not weigh down any of you. During that time, we preached to you the gospel of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_10" data-id="H12_10">You are witnesses, and God also, how holy, righteous, and blameless was our behavior toward you who believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_11" data-id="H12_11">In the same way you know how we dealt with each one of you as a father deals with his own children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_12" data-id="H12_12">We were begging you and encouraging and urging you to walk in a manner that is worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_13" data-id="H12_13">For this reason we also thank God constantly. For when you received from us God's message that you heard, you accepted it not as the word of man. Instead, you received it as it truly is, the word of God. It is this word that is also at work among you who believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_14" data-id="H12_14">For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, as they did from the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_15" data-id="H12_15">It was the Jews who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets. It was the Jews who drove us out. They do not please God. Instead, they are hostile to all people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_16" data-id="H12_16">They forbid us to speak to the Gentiles for them to be saved. The result is that they always fill up their own sins. But wrath will overtake them in the end.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_17" data-id="H12_17">But we, brothers, were separated from you for a short time, in person not in heart. We were especially eager, with great desire, to see your face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_18" data-id="H12_18">For we wished to come to you—I, Paul, wished to come to you once and again—but Satan stopped us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_19" data-id="H12_19">For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of pride in front of our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you just as much as others?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v H12_20" data-id="H12_20">For you are our glory and our joy.</span>
