<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_23" data-id="MT21_23">When Jesus had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said, "By what authority do you do these things, and who gave you this authority?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_24" data-id="MT21_24">Jesus answered and said to them, "I also will ask you one question. If you tell me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span>

They discussed among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_26" data-id="MT21_26">But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the crowd, because they all view John as a prophet."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_27" data-id="MT21_27">Then they answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_28" data-id="MT21_28">But what do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go work today in the vineyard.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_29" data-id="MT21_29">The son answered and said, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind and went.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_30" data-id="MT21_30">Then the man went to the second son and said the same thing. He answered and said, 'I will go, sir,' but he did not go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_31" data-id="MT21_31">Which of the two sons did his father's will?" They said, "The first one." Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_32" data-id="MT21_32">For John came to you in the way of righteousness, but you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. But you, even when you saw this, you did not repent afterward and believe him.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_33" data-id="MT21_33">Listen to another parable. There was a man, a landowner. He planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a watchtower, and rented it out to vine growers. Then he went into another country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_34" data-id="MT21_34">When the time of the fruit harvest approached, he sent some servants to the vine growers to get his fruit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_35" data-id="MT21_35">But the vine growers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned still another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_36" data-id="MT21_36">Again, the owner sent other servants, more than the first, but the vine growers treated them in the same way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_37" data-id="MT21_37">After that, the owner sent his own son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_38" data-id="MT21_38">But when the vine growers saw the son, they said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take over the inheritance.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_39" data-id="MT21_39">So they took him, threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_40" data-id="MT21_40">Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine growers?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_41" data-id="MT21_41">They said to him, "He will destroy those miserable men in the most severe way, and will then rent out the vineyard to other vine growers, men who will give him his share of crops at the harvest time."</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_42" data-id="MT21_42">Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the scriptures,</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v MT21_42" data-id="MT21_42">'The stone which the builders rejected</div>

<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_43" data-id="MT21_43">Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation that produces its fruits.</span>

<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_45" data-id="MT21_45">When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they understood he was speaking about them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_46" data-id="MT21_46">Seeking to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowd, because the people regarded him as a prophet.</span>
