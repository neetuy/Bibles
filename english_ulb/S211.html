<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_1" data-id="S211_1">It came about in the springtime, at the time when kings normally go to war, that David sent out Joab, his servants, and all the army of Israel. They destroyed the army of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed in Jerusalem.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_2" data-id="S211_2">So it came about one evening that David got up from his bed and walked on the roof of his palace. From there he happened to see a woman who was bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_3" data-id="S211_3">So David sent and he asked people who would know about the woman. Someone said, "Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, and is she not the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_4" data-id="S211_4">David sent messengers and took her; she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she had just purified herself from menstruation). Then she returned to her house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_5" data-id="S211_5">The woman conceived, and she sent and told David; she said, "I am pregnant."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_6" data-id="S211_6">Then David sent to Joab saying, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent Uriah to David.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_7" data-id="S211_7">When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab was, how the army was doing, and how the war was going.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_8" data-id="S211_8">David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." So Uriah left the king's palace, and the king sent a gift for Uriah after he left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_9" data-id="S211_9">But Uriah slept at the door of the king's palace with all the servants of his master, and he did not go down to his house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_10" data-id="S211_10">When they told David, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_11" data-id="S211_11">Uriah answered David, "The ark, and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my master's servants are camped in an open field. How then can I go into my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? As sure as you are alive, I will not do this."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_12" data-id="S211_12">So David said to Uriah, "Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you leave." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_13" data-id="S211_13">When David called him, he ate and drank before him, and David made him drunk. At evening Uriah went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his master; he did not go down to his house.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_14" data-id="S211_14">So in the morning David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_15" data-id="S211_15">David wrote in the letter saying, "Set Uriah at the very front of the most intense battle, and then withdraw from him, that he may be hit and killed."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_16" data-id="S211_16">So as Joab watched the siege upon the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew the strongest enemy soldiers would be fighting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_17" data-id="S211_17">When the men of the city went out and fought against Joab's army, some of the soldiers of David fell, and Uriah the Hittite was also killed there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_18" data-id="S211_18">When Joab sent word to David about everything concerning the war,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_19" data-id="S211_19">he commanded the messenger, saying, "When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_20" data-id="S211_20">it may happen that the king will become angry, and he will say to you, 'Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_21" data-id="S211_21">Who killed Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' Then you must answer, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_22" data-id="S211_22">So the messenger left and went to David and told him everything that Joab had sent him to say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_23" data-id="S211_23">Then the messenger said to David, "The enemy were stronger than we were at first; they came out to us into the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_24" data-id="S211_24">Then their shooters shot at your soldiers from off the wall, and some of the king's servants were killed, and your servant Uriah the Hittite was killed too."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_25" data-id="S211_25">Then David said to the messenger, "Say this to Joab, 'Do not let this displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle even stronger against the city, and overthrow it,' and encourage him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_26" data-id="S211_26">So when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented deeply for her husband.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_27" data-id="S211_27">When her sorrow passed, David sent and took her home to his palace, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But what David had done displeased Yahweh.</span>
