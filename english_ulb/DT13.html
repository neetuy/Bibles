<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT13_3" data-id="DT13_3">do not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams; for Yahweh your God is testing you to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul.</span>

That prophet wants to draw you out of the way in which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk. So put away the evil from among you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT13_13" data-id="DT13_13">Some wicked fellows have gone out from among you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city and said, 'Let us go and worship other gods that you have not known.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT13_14" data-id="DT13_14">Then you will examine the evidence, make search, and investigate it thoroughly. When you discover that it is true and certain that such an abominable thing has been done among you, then you will take action.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT13_15" data-id="DT13_15">You will surely attack the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, completely destroy it and all the people who are in it, along with its livestock, with the edge of the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT13_16" data-id="DT13_16">You will gather all the spoil from it into the middle of its street and will burn the city, as well as all its spoil—for Yahweh your God.

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT13_18" data-id="DT13_18">He will do this because you are listening to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all his commandments that I am commanding you today, to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.</span>
