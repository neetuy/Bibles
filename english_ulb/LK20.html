<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_2" data-id="LK20_2">They spoke, saying to him, "Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who it is who gave you this authority."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_3" data-id="LK20_3">He answered and said to them, "I will also ask you a question, and you tell me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_4" data-id="LK20_4">The baptism of John: was it from heaven or from men?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_5" data-id="LK20_5">They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_6" data-id="LK20_6">But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_7" data-id="LK20_7">So they answered that they did not know where it came from.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_8" data-id="LK20_8">Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_10" data-id="LK20_10">At the appointed time he sent a servant to the vine growers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vine growers beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_11" data-id="LK20_11">He then sent yet another servant and they also beat him, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_12" data-id="LK20_12">He also sent yet a third and they also wounded him, and threw him out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_13" data-id="LK20_13">So the lord of the vineyard said, 'What will I do? I will send my beloved son. Maybe they will respect him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_14" data-id="LK20_14">But when the vine growers saw him, they discussed among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_15" data-id="LK20_15">They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the lord of the vineyard do to them?</span>

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_19" data-id="LK20_19">So the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour, for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_20" data-id="LK20_20">Watching him carefully, they sent out spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might find fault with his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_21" data-id="LK20_21">They asked him, saying, "Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, and are not influenced by anyone's position, but you teach the truth about the way of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_22" data-id="LK20_22">Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_23" data-id="LK20_23">But Jesus understood their craftiness, and said to them,</span>

<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_25" data-id="LK20_25">He said to them, "Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</span>

<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_27" data-id="LK20_27">When some of the Sadducees came to him, the ones who say that there is no resurrection,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_28" data-id="LK20_28">they asked him, saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife, and being childless, the man should take the brother's wife, and have a child for his brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_29" data-id="LK20_29">There were seven brothers and the first took a wife, and died childless,</span>

<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_31" data-id="LK20_31">The third took her, and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_32" data-id="LK20_32">Afterward the woman also died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_33" data-id="LK20_33">In the resurrection then, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as their wife."</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_34" data-id="LK20_34">Jesus said to them, "The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_35" data-id="LK20_35">But those who are regarded as worthy in that age to receive the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_36" data-id="LK20_36">Neither can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_37" data-id="LK20_37">But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the place concerning the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_38" data-id="LK20_38">Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, because all live to him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK20_39" data-id="LK20_39">Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you have answered well."</span>
