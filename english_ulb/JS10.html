<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_1" data-id="JS10_1">Now when Adoni-Zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured Ai and had completely destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and its king), he also heard how the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_2" data-id="JS10_2">The people of Jerusalem were very afraid because Gibeon was a large city, like one of the royal cities. It was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty warriors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_3" data-id="JS10_3">So Adoni-Zedek, king of Jerusalem, sent a message to Hoham, king of Hebron, to Piram, king of Jarmuth, to Japhia, king of Lachish, and to Debir, king of Eglon:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_4" data-id="JS10_4">"Come up to me and help me. Let us attack Gibeon because they have made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_5" data-id="JS10_5">The five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon came up, they and all their armies. They set up their positions against Gibeon, and they attacked it.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_6" data-id="JS10_6">The people of Gibeon sent a message to Joshua and to the army at Gilgal. They said, "Hurry! Do not withdraw your hands from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us. Help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who live in the hill country have gathered together to attack us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_7" data-id="JS10_7">Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the men of war with him, and all the fighting men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_8" data-id="JS10_8">Yahweh said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them. I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to stop your attack."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_9" data-id="JS10_9">Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_10" data-id="JS10_10">Yahweh confused the enemy before Israel, and Israel killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon and pursued them on the road going up to Beth Horon, and they killed them on the road to Azekah and Makkedah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_11" data-id="JS10_11">As they ran away from Israel, down the hill from Beth Horon, Yahweh threw large stones down from heaven upon them all the way to Azekah, and they died. There were more who died because of the hailstones than who were killed with the sword by the men of Israel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_12" data-id="JS10_12">Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh on the day Yahweh gave the men of Israel victory over the Amorites. This is what Joshua said to Yahweh before Israel,</span>

<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_17" data-id="JS10_17">It was told to Joshua, "They have been found!—the five kings hidden in the cave at Makkedah!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_18" data-id="JS10_18">Joshua said, "Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and place soldiers there to guard them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_20" data-id="JS10_20">Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished slaughtering them with a very great slaughter, until they were almost completely destroyed; only a few survivors who escaped reached the fortified cities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_21" data-id="JS10_21">Then the whole army returned in peace to Joshua at the camp at Makkedah. No one dared to say one word against any of the people of Israel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_22" data-id="JS10_22">Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and out of the cave bring to me these five kings."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_23" data-id="JS10_23">They did as he said. They brought to him these five kings from the cave—the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_24" data-id="JS10_24">When they brought the kings to Joshua, he summoned every man of Israel. He said to the commanders of the soldiers who had gone into battle with him, "Put your feet on their necks." So they came up and put their feet on their necks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_25" data-id="JS10_25">Then he said to them, "Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed. Be strong and courageous. This is what Yahweh will do to all your enemies you are going to fight."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_26" data-id="JS10_26">Then Joshua attacked and killed the kings. He hung them on five trees. They hung on the trees until evening.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_27" data-id="JS10_27">When it was sunset, Joshua gave orders, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves.
