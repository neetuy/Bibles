<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_26" data-id="LK4_26">But Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath in Sidon, to a widow living there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_27" data-id="LK4_27">There were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, but none of them were healed except Naaman the Syrian."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_28" data-id="LK4_28">All the people in the synagogue were filled with rage when they heard these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_29" data-id="LK4_29">They got up, forced him out of the town, and led him to the cliff of the hill on which their town was built, so they might throw him off the cliff.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_30" data-id="LK4_30">But he passed through the middle of them and he went to another place.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_31" data-id="LK4_31">Then he went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and he began to teach them on the Sabbath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_32" data-id="LK4_32">They were astonished at his teaching, because he spoke with authority.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_33" data-id="LK4_33">Now in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_34" data-id="LK4_34">"Ah! What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you areâ€”the Holy One of God!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_35" data-id="LK4_35">Jesus rebuked the demon, saying, "Do not speak! Come out of him!" When the demon had thrown the man down in the middle of them, he came out of him, and did not harm him in any way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_36" data-id="LK4_36">All the people were very amazed, and they kept talking about it with one another. They said, "What kind of words are these? He commands the unclean spirits with authority and power and they come out."</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_37" data-id="LK4_37">So news about him began to spread into every part of the surrounding region.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_38" data-id="LK4_38">Then Jesus left the synagogue and entered into the house of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering with a high fever, and they pleaded with him on her behalf.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_39" data-id="LK4_39">So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she got up and started serving them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_40" data-id="LK4_40">When the sun was setting, people brought to Jesus everyone who was sick with various kinds of diseases. He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_41" data-id="LK4_41">Demons also came out from many of them, crying out and saying, "You are the Son of God!" Jesus rebuked the demons and would not let them speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_42" data-id="LK4_42">When daybreak came, he went out into a solitary place. Crowds of people were looking for him and came to the place where he was. They tried to keep him from going away from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_43" data-id="LK4_43">But he said to them, "I must also preach the gospel about the kingdom of God to many other cities, because this is the reason I was sent here."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_44" data-id="LK4_44">Then he continued to preach in the synagogues throughout Judea.</span>
