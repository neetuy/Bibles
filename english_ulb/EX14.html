<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_2" data-id="EX14_2">"Say to the Israelites that they should turn and camp before Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You are to camp by the sea opposite Pi Hahiroth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_3" data-id="EX14_3">Pharaoh will say about the Israelites, 'They are wandering in the land. The wilderness has closed in on them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_4" data-id="EX14_4">I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them. I will get honor because of Pharaoh and all his army. The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh." So the Israelites camped as they were instructed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_5" data-id="EX14_5">When the king of Egypt was told that the Israelites had fled, the minds of Pharaoh and his servants turned against the people. They said, "What have we done? We have released Israel from serving us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_6" data-id="EX14_6">Then Pharaoh got his chariots ready and took his army with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_7" data-id="EX14_7">He took six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers on all of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_8" data-id="EX14_8">Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and the king pursued the Israelites. Now the Israelites had gone away in triumph.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_11" data-id="EX14_11">They said to Moses, "Is it because there were no graves in Egypt, that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us like this, bringing us out of Egypt?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_12" data-id="EX14_12">Is this not what we told you in Egypt? We said to you, 'Leave us alone, so we can work for the Egyptians.' It would have been better for us to work for them than to die in the wilderness."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_13" data-id="EX14_13">Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid. Stand still and see the rescue that Yahweh will provide for you today. For you will never see again the Egyptians whom you see today.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_15" data-id="EX14_15">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Why are you, Moses, continuing to call out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_18" data-id="EX14_18">Then the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I have gotten honor because of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_19" data-id="EX14_19">The angel of God, who went before the Israelites, moved and went behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from before them and went to stand behind them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_20" data-id="EX14_20">The cloud came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. It was a dark cloud to the Egyptians, but it lit the night for the Israelites, so one side did not come near the other all night.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_21" data-id="EX14_21">Moses reached out with his hand over the sea. Yahweh drove the sea back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea into dry land. In this way the waters were divided.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_22" data-id="EX14_22">The Israelites went into the middle of the sea on dry ground. The waters formed a wall for them on their right hand and on their left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_23" data-id="EX14_23">The Egyptians pursued them. They went after them into the middle of the seaâ€”all Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_24" data-id="EX14_24">But in the early morning hours, Yahweh looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and cloud. He caused panic among the Egyptians.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_25" data-id="EX14_25">Their chariot wheels were clogged, and the horsemen drove with difficulty. So the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from Israel, for Yahweh is fighting for them against us."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_26" data-id="EX14_26">Yahweh said to Moses, "Reach out with your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back onto the Egyptians, their chariots, and their horsemen."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_27" data-id="EX14_27">So Moses reached out with his hand over the sea, and it returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. The Egyptians fled into the sea, and Yahweh drove the Egyptians into the middle of it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_28" data-id="EX14_28">The waters came back and covered Pharaoh's chariots, horsemen, and his entire army that had followed the chariots into the sea. No one survived.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_29" data-id="EX14_29">However, the Israelites walked on dry land in the middle of the sea. The waters were a wall for them on their right hand and on their left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_30" data-id="EX14_30">So Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw dead Egyptians on the seashore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX14_31" data-id="EX14_31">When Israel saw the great power that Yahweh used against the Egyptians, the people honored Yahweh, and they trusted in Yahweh and in his servant Moses.</span>
