<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_1" data-id="GL5_1">For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not again be put under the control of a yoke of slavery.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_2" data-id="GL5_2">Look, I, Paul, say to you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will not benefit you in any way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_3" data-id="GL5_3">I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_4" data-id="GL5_4">You are cut off from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you no longer experience grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_5" data-id="GL5_5">For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_6" data-id="GL5_6">In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but only faith working through love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_7" data-id="GL5_7">You were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_8" data-id="GL5_8">This persuasion does not come from him who calls you!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_9" data-id="GL5_9">A little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_10" data-id="GL5_10">I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is troubling you will pay the penalty, whoever he is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_11" data-id="GL5_11">Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_12" data-id="GL5_12">As for those who are disturbing you, I wish they would castrate themselves!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_13" data-id="GL5_13">For you were called to freedom, brothers. But do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the sinful nature; rather, through love serve one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_14" data-id="GL5_14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one command: "You must love your neighbor as yourself."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_15" data-id="GL5_15">But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_16" data-id="GL5_16">But I say, walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the sinful nature.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_17" data-id="GL5_17">For the desires of the sinful nature are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the sinful nature. For these are in conflict with each other, so that you cannot do the things you want.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_18" data-id="GL5_18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_19" data-id="GL5_19">Now the works of the sinful nature are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, depravity,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_20" data-id="GL5_20">idolatry, sorcery, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, rivalry, dissension, divisions,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_21" data-id="GL5_21">envy, drunkenness, drunken celebrations, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_22" data-id="GL5_22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_23" data-id="GL5_23">gentleness, and self-control; against such things there is no law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_24" data-id="GL5_24">Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_25" data-id="GL5_25">If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_26" data-id="GL5_26">Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</span>
