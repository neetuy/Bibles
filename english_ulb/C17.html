<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_1" data-id="C17_1">Now concerning the issues you wrote about: "It is good for a man not to touch a woman."</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_2" data-id="C17_2">But because of temptations for many immoral acts, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_3" data-id="C17_3">The husband should give to the wife her sexual rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_4" data-id="C17_4">It is not the wife who has authority over her own body, it is the husband. Likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_5" data-id="C17_5">Do not deprive each other, except by mutual agreement and for a specific period of time. Do this so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then you should come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_6" data-id="C17_6">But I say these things to you as a concession and not as a command.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_7" data-id="C17_7">I wish that everyone were as I am. But each one has his own gift from God. One has this kind of gift, and another that kind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_8" data-id="C17_8">To the unmarried and to widows I say that it is good for them if they remain unmarried, as I am.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_9" data-id="C17_9">But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better for them to marry than to burn with passion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_10" data-id="C17_10">Now to the married I give this command—not I, but the Lord—the wife should not separate from her husband</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_11" data-id="C17_11">(but if she does separate from her husband, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_12" data-id="C17_12">But to the rest I say—I, not the Lord—that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and if she is content to live with him, he should not divorce her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_13" data-id="C17_13">If a woman has an unbelieving husband, and if he is content to live with her, she should not divorce him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_14" data-id="C17_14">For the unbelieving husband is set apart because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is set apart because of the brother. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but actually they are set apart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_15" data-id="C17_15">But if the unbelieving partner departs, let him go. In such cases, the brother or sister is not bound to their vows. God has called us to live in peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_16" data-id="C17_16">For how do you know, woman, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_17" data-id="C17_17">Only let each one live the life the Lord has assigned him, each as God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_18" data-id="C17_18">Was anyone circumcised when he was called to believe? He should not try to appear uncircumcised. Was anyone uncircumcised when he was called to faith? He should not be circumcised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_19" data-id="C17_19">For it is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision that matters. What matters is obeying the commandments of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_20" data-id="C17_20">Each one should remain in the calling he was in when God called him to believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_21" data-id="C17_21">Were you a slave when God called you? Do not be concerned about it. But if you can become free, take advantage of it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_22" data-id="C17_22">For someone who is called by the Lord as a slave is the Lord's freeman. Likewise, the one who was free when he was called to believe is Christ's slave.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_23" data-id="C17_23">You have been bought with a price, so do not become slaves of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_24" data-id="C17_24">Brothers, in whatever life each of us was in when we were called to believe, let us remain like that.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_25" data-id="C17_25">Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the Lord. But I give my opinion as one who, by the Lord's mercy, is trustworthy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_26" data-id="C17_26">Therefore, I think that because of the disaster that is coming, it is good for a man to remain as he is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_27" data-id="C17_27">Are you married to a wife? Do not seek a divorce. If you are unmarried, do not seek a wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_28" data-id="C17_28">But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if an unmarried woman marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will have many kinds of worldly trouble, and I want to spare you from this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_29" data-id="C17_29">But this I say, brothers: The time is short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_30" data-id="C17_30">Those who weep should act as though they were not weeping, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not possess anything,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_31" data-id="C17_31">and those who use the world should not act as though they are using it to the full. For the world in its present form is coming to an end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_32" data-id="C17_32">I would like you to be free from worries. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to please him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_33" data-id="C17_33">But the married man is concerned about the things of the world, how to please his wife—</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_34" data-id="C17_34">he is divided. The unmarried woman or the virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to be set apart in body and in spirit. But the married woman is concerned about the things of the world, how to please her husband.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_35" data-id="C17_35">I say this for your own benefit, and not to put any constraint on you. I say this for what is right, so that you may be devoted to the Lord without any distraction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_36" data-id="C17_36">But if anyone thinks that he is not treating his fiancée with respect—if she is beyond the age of marriage and it must be so—he should do what he wants. He is not sinning. They should marry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_37" data-id="C17_37">But if he is standing firm in his heart, if he is not under pressure but can control his own will, and if he has decided in his own heart to do this, to keep his own fiancée a virgin, he will do well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_38" data-id="C17_38">So the one who marries his fiancée does well, and the one who chooses not to marry will do even better.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_39" data-id="C17_39">A woman is bound to her husband for as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she wishes to marry, but only in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v C17_40" data-id="C17_40">Yet in my judgment she would be happier if she lives as she is. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</span>
