<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_2" data-id="C213_2">I have already said to those who sinned before and to all the rest when I was there the second time, and I say it again: When I come again, I will not spare them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_3" data-id="C213_3">I tell you this because you are looking for evidence that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak toward you. Instead, he is powerful in you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_4" data-id="C213_4">For he was crucified in weakness, but he is alive by God's power. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him by the power of God among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_5" data-id="C213_5">Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not realize this about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless you have failed the test.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_6" data-id="C213_6">And I trust that you will recognize that we have not failed the test.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_7" data-id="C213_7">Now we pray to God that you may not do any wrong. I do not pray that we may appear to have passed the test. Instead, I pray that you may do what is right, although we may seem to have failed the test.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_8" data-id="C213_8">For we are not able to do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_9" data-id="C213_9">For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. We also pray that you may be made complete.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_10" data-id="C213_10">I write these things while I am away from you, so that when I am with you I do not have to deal harshly with you in the use of my authority—which the Lord gave to me, so that I may build you up, and not tear you down.</span>
