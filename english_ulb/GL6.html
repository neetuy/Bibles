<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_1" data-id="GL6_1">Brothers, if someone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Be concerned about yourself, so you also may not be tempted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_2" data-id="GL6_2">Carry one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_3" data-id="GL6_3">For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_4" data-id="GL6_4">Each one should examine his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in someone else.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_5" data-id="GL6_5">For each one will carry his own load.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_6" data-id="GL6_6">The one who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_7" data-id="GL6_7">Do not be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man plants, that he will also gather in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_8" data-id="GL6_8">For he who plants seed to his own sinful nature, from the sinful nature will gather in destruction. The one who plants seed to the Spirit, from the Spirit will gather in eternal life from the Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_9" data-id="GL6_9">Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the right time we will gather in a harvest, if we do not give up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_10" data-id="GL6_10">So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the household of faith.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_11" data-id="GL6_11">See what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_12" data-id="GL6_12">Those who want to make a good impression in the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. They do this only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_13" data-id="GL6_13">For not even those who circumcised themselves keep the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_14" data-id="GL6_14">But may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_15" data-id="GL6_15">For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but what counts is a new creation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_16" data-id="GL6_16">To all who live according to this standard, peace and mercy be upon them, even upon the Israel of God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_17" data-id="GL6_17">From now on let no one trouble me, for I carry on my body the marks of Jesus.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_18" data-id="GL6_18">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. </span>
