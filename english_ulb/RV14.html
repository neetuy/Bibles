<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_1" data-id="RV14_1">I looked and saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_2" data-id="RV14_2">I heard a voice from heaven sounding like a roar of many waters and loud thunder. The sound I heard was also like harpists playing their harps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_3" data-id="RV14_3">They sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except for the 144,000 who had been bought from the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_4" data-id="RV14_4">These are the ones that have not defiled themselves with women, for they have kept themselves sexually pure. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were bought out of mankind as firstfruits for God and for the Lamb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_5" data-id="RV14_5">No lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless. <span class="note" id="footnote-338"><a href="#note-338" class="key">†</a></span></span>

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_6" data-id="RV14_6">I saw another angel flying in midair, who had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_7" data-id="RV14_7">He called out with a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory. For the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him, the one who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of water."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_8" data-id="RV14_8">Another angel—a second angel—followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who persuaded all the nations to drink the wine of her immoral passion."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_9" data-id="RV14_9">Another angel—a third angel—followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_10" data-id="RV14_10">he will also drink some of the wine of God's wrath, the wine that has been poured undiluted into the cup of his anger.

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_11" data-id="RV14_11">The smoke from their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest day or night—these worshipers of the beast and his image, and everyone who receives the mark of his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_12" data-id="RV14_12">Here is a call for the patient endurance of the saints, those who obey the commandments of God and faith in Jesus."</span>

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_14" data-id="RV14_14">I looked, and there was a white cloud. Seated on the cloud was one like a son of man. He had a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_15" data-id="RV14_15">Then another angel came out of the temple and called with a loud voice to the one sitting on the cloud: "Take your sickle and start to reap.
