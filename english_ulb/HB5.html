<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_1" data-id="HB5_1">For every high priest, chosen from among people, is appointed to act on the behalf of people in the things concerning God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_2" data-id="HB5_2">He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and who have been deceived, because he himself is subject to weakness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_3" data-id="HB5_3">Because of this, he also is required to offer sacrifices for his own sins, just as he does for the people's sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_4" data-id="HB5_4">It is not for himself that anyone takes this honor. Instead, he is called by God, just as Aaron was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_5" data-id="HB5_5">In the same way, neither did Christ honor himself by making himself high priest. Instead, the one speaking to him said,</span>

<span class="v HB5_5" data-id="HB5_5">"You are my Son;</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB5_5" data-id="HB5_5">today I have become your Father."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_6" data-id="HB5_6">It is just as he also says in another place,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB5_6" data-id="HB5_6">"You are a priest forever</div>

<div class="q">
<span class="v HB5_6" data-id="HB5_6">after the manner of Melchizedek."</div>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_7" data-id="HB5_7">During the days of his flesh, Christ offered up both prayers and requests with loud cries and tears to God, the one able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his godly life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_8" data-id="HB5_8">Even though he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_9" data-id="HB5_9">He was made perfect and became, for everyone who obeys him, the cause of eternal salvation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_10" data-id="HB5_10">He was designated by God as high priest after the manner of Melchizedek.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_11" data-id="HB5_11">We have much to say about Jesus, but it is hard to explain since you have become dull in hearing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_12" data-id="HB5_12">For though by this time you should be teachers, you still have need for someone to teach you the basic principles of God's messages. You need milk, not solid food!</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_13" data-id="HB5_13">For anyone who only takes milk is inexperienced with the message of righteousness, because he is still a little child.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_14" data-id="HB5_14">But solid food is for adults. These are those who because of their maturity have their understanding trained for distinguishing good from evil.</span>
