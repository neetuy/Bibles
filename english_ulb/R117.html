<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_2" data-id="R117_2">Then Nathan said to David, "Go, do what is in your heart, for God is with you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_3" data-id="R117_3">But that same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_4" data-id="R117_4">"Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what Yahweh says: You will not build me a house in which to live.</span>
