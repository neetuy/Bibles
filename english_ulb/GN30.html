<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_16" data-id="GN30_16">Jacob came from the field in the evening. Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So Jacob lay with Leah that night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_17" data-id="GN30_17">God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_25" data-id="GN30_25">After Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, so that I may go to my own home and to my country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_26" data-id="GN30_26">Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go, for you know the service I have given you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_27" data-id="GN30_27">Laban said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, wait, because I have learned by using divination that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_28" data-id="GN30_28">Then he said, "Name your wages, and I will pay them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_29" data-id="GN30_29">Jacob said to him, "You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_30" data-id="GN30_30">For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I worked. Now when will I provide for my own household also?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_31" data-id="GN30_31">So Laban said, "What will I pay you?" Jacob said, "You will not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_32" data-id="GN30_32">Let me walk through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. These will be my wages.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_33" data-id="GN30_33">My integrity will testify for me later on, when you come to check on my wages. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, if any are found with me, will be considered to be stolen."</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_34" data-id="GN30_34">Laban said, "Agreed. Let it be according to your word."</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_35" data-id="GN30_35">That day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_36" data-id="GN30_36">Laban also put three days' journey between himself and Jacob. So Jacob kept tending the rest of Laban's flocks.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_37" data-id="GN30_37">Jacob took fresh cut branches of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree, and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white inner wood appear that was in the sticks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_38" data-id="GN30_38">Then he set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks, in front of the watering troughs where they came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_39" data-id="GN30_39">The flocks bred in front of the sticks; and the flocks produced striped, speckled, and spotted young.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_40" data-id="GN30_40">Jacob separated out these lambs, but made the rest of them face toward the striped animals and all the black sheep in the flock of Laban. Then he separated out his flocks for himself alone and did not put them together with Laban's flocks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_41" data-id="GN30_41">Whenever the stronger sheep in the flock were breeding, then Jacob would lay the sticks in the watering troughs before the eyes of the flock, so that they might conceive among the sticks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_42" data-id="GN30_42">But when the feebler animals in the flock came, he did not put the sticks in front of them. So the feebler animals were Laban's, and the stronger were Jacob's.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN30_43" data-id="GN30_43">The man became very prosperous. He had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</span>
