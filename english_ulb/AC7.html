<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_1" data-id="AC7_1">The high priest said, "Are these things true?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_2" data-id="AC7_2">Stephen said,</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v AC7_2" data-id="AC7_2">"Brothers and fathers, listen to me: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_3" data-id="AC7_3">he said to him, 'Leave your land and your relatives, and go into the land that I will show you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_4" data-id="AC7_4">Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran; from there, after his father died, God brought him into this land, where you live now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_5" data-id="AC7_5">He gave none of it as an inheritance to him, no, not even enough to set a foot on. But he promised—even though Abraham had no child yet—that he would give the land as a possession to him and to his descendants after him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_6" data-id="AC7_6">God was speaking to him like this, that his descendants would live for a while in a foreign land, and that the inhabitants there would bring them into slavery and treat them badly for four hundred years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_7" data-id="AC7_7">'But I will judge the nation that they serve,' said God, 'and after that they will come out and worship me in this place.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_8" data-id="AC7_8">Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_9" data-id="AC7_9">Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him into Egypt; but God was with him</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_10" data-id="AC7_10">and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who had made him governor over Egypt and over all his household.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_11" data-id="AC7_11">Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great suffering, and our fathers could find no food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_12" data-id="AC7_12">But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first trip.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_13" data-id="AC7_13">On their second trip Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_14" data-id="AC7_14">Joseph sent his brothers back to tell Jacob his father to come to Egypt, along with all his relatives, seventy-five persons in all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_15" data-id="AC7_15">So Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_16" data-id="AC7_16">They were carried over to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_17" data-id="AC7_17">As the time of the promise approached, the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_18" data-id="AC7_18">until there arose another king over Egypt, a king who did not know about Joseph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_19" data-id="AC7_19">He deceived our people and forced our fathers to expose their newborn infants so they would not be kept alive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_20" data-id="AC7_20">At that time Moses was born; he was very beautiful before God and was nourished for three months in his father's house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_21" data-id="AC7_21">When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and raised him as her own son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_22" data-id="AC7_22">Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_23" data-id="AC7_23">But when he was about forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_24" data-id="AC7_24">Seeing an Israelite being mistreated, Moses defended him and avenged him who was oppressed by striking the Egyptian:</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_25" data-id="AC7_25">he thought that his brothers would understand that God by his hand was rescuing them, but they did not understand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_26" data-id="AC7_26">On the next day he came to some Israelites as they were quarreling; he tried to put them at peace with each other; he said, 'Men, you are brothers; why are you hurting one another?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_27" data-id="AC7_27">But the one who had wronged his neighbor pushed him away, and said, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_28" data-id="AC7_28">Would you like to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_29" data-id="AC7_29">Moses ran away after hearing this; he became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_30" data-id="AC7_30">When forty years were past, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_31" data-id="AC7_31">When Moses saw the fire, he marveled at the sight; and as he approached to look at it, there came a voice of the Lord, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_32" data-id="AC7_32">'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob.' Moses trembled and did not dare to look.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_33" data-id="AC7_33">The Lord said to him, 'Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_34" data-id="AC7_34">I have certainly seen the suffering of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them; now come, I will send you to Egypt.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_35" data-id="AC7_35">This Moses whom they rejected, when they said, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'—he was the one whom God sent as both a ruler and deliverer. God sent him by the hand of the angel who appeared to Moses in the bush.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_36" data-id="AC7_36">Moses led them out of Egypt, after doing miracles and signs in Egypt and at the Sea of Reeds, and in the wilderness during forty years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_37" data-id="AC7_37">It is the same Moses who said to the people of Israel, 'God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, a prophet like me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_38" data-id="AC7_38">This is the man who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who had spoken to him on Mount Sinai. This is the man who was with our fathers; this is the man who received living words to give to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_39" data-id="AC7_39">This is the man whom our fathers refused to obey; they pushed him away from themselves, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_40" data-id="AC7_40">At that time they said to Aaron, 'Make us gods who will lead us. As for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_41" data-id="AC7_41">So they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced because of the work of their hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_42" data-id="AC7_42">But God turned and gave them up to worship the stars in the sky, as it is written in the book of the prophets,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_42" data-id="AC7_42">'Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_42" data-id="AC7_42">for forty years in the wilderness, house of Israel?</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_43" data-id="AC7_43">You accepted the tabernacle of Molech</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_43" data-id="AC7_43">and the star of the god Rephan,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_43" data-id="AC7_43">and the images that you made to worship them:</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_43" data-id="AC7_43">and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.'</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_44" data-id="AC7_44">Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, just as God commanded when he spoke to Moses, that he should make it like the pattern that he had seen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_45" data-id="AC7_45">Later, our fathers, under Joshua, received the tabernacle and brought it with them when they took possession of the land. God took the land from the nations and drove them out before the face of our fathers. The tabernacle remained in the land until the time of David,</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_46" data-id="AC7_46">who found favor in the sight of God, and he asked if he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_47" data-id="AC7_47">But it was Solomon who built the house for God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_48" data-id="AC7_48">However, the Most High does not live in houses made with hands, as the prophet says,</span>

<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_49" data-id="AC7_49">'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool for my feet.</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_49" data-id="AC7_49">What kind of house can you build for me? says the Lord,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_49" data-id="AC7_49">or what is the place for my rest?</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_50" data-id="AC7_50">Did my hand not make all these things?'</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_51" data-id="AC7_51">You people who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; you act just as your fathers acted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_52" data-id="AC7_52">Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed the prophets who appeared in advance of the coming of the Righteous One; and you have now become the betrayers and murderers of him also,</span>
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_53" data-id="AC7_53">you people who received the law that angels had established, but you did not keep it."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-54 " data-id="bibleJsn">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_54" data-id="AC7_54">Now when the council members heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they ground their teeth at Stephen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55 " data-id="bibleJsn">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_55" data-id="AC7_55">But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up intently into heaven and saw the glory of God; and he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56 " data-id="bibleJsn">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_56" data-id="AC7_56">Stephen said, "Look, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-57 " data-id="bibleJsn">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_57" data-id="AC7_57">At this the council members covered their ears, and shouting out with a loud voice, altogether they rushed at him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-58 " data-id="bibleJsn">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_58" data-id="AC7_58">They dragged him out of the city where they began to stone him, and the witnesses laid down their outer clothing at the feet of a young man named Saul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59 " data-id="bibleJsn">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_59" data-id="AC7_59">As they were stoning Stephen, he was calling out to the Lord and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."</span>
<span class="v-num v-60 " data-id="bibleJsn">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_60" data-id="AC7_60">He knelt down and called out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." When he had said this, he fell asleep.</span>
