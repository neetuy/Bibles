<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_2" data-id="NH9_2">The descendants of Israel separated themselves from all the foreigners. They stood and confessed their own sins and the evil actions of their ancestors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_3" data-id="NH9_3">They stood up in their places, and for one-fourth of the day they read from the book of the law of Yahweh their God.

<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_4" data-id="NH9_4">The Levites, Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani, stood on the stairs and they called out with a loud voice to Yahweh their God.</span>

You have kept your promise because you are righteous.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_9" data-id="NH9_9">You saw the affliction of our forefathers in Egypt and you heard their cry by the Sea of Reeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_10" data-id="NH9_10">You gave signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and all his servants, and on all the people of his land, for you knew that the Egyptians acted with arrogance against them. But you made a name for yourself which stands to this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_11" data-id="NH9_11">Then you divided the sea before them, so that they went through the middle of the sea on the dry land; and threw those who pursued them into the depths, as a stone into deep waters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_12" data-id="NH9_12">You led them by a pillar of cloud during by day, and by a pillar of fire during the night to light the way for them to go.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_16" data-id="NH9_16">But they and our ancestors acted disrespectfully, and they were stubborn, and did not listen to your commandments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_17" data-id="NH9_17">They refused to listen, and they did not think about the wonders that you had done among them, but became stubborn, and in their rebellion they appointed a leader to return to their slavery. But you are a God who is full of forgiveness, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love. You did not abandon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_18" data-id="NH9_18">Even when they had cast a calf out of molten metal and said, 'This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' and had committed great blasphemies,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_19" data-id="NH9_19">you, in your compassion, did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud to lead them on the way did not leave them during day, neither did the pillar of fire by night to light the way for them to go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_20" data-id="NH9_20">Your good Spirit you gave them to instruct them, and your manna you did not withhold from their mouths, and water you gave them for their thirst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_21" data-id="NH9_21">For forty years you provided for them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_22" data-id="NH9_22">You gave them kingdoms and peoples, assigning to them every corner of the land. Then they took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan.  </span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_23" data-id="NH9_23">You made their children as numerous as the stars of heaven, and you brought them into the land that you told their ancestors to go in and possess.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_24" data-id="NH9_24">So the people went in and possessed the land and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites. You gave them into their hands, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that Israel might do with them as they pleased.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_25" data-id="NH9_25">They captured the fortified cities and a productive land, and they captured houses full of all good things, cisterns already cut out, vineyards and olive orchards, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were satisfied and grew fat and enjoyed themselves in your great goodness.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_26" data-id="NH9_26">Then they became disobedient and they rebelled against you. They threw your law behind their backs. They murdered your prophets who had warned them to turn back to you, and they committed great blasphemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_27" data-id="NH9_27">So you gave them into the hand of their enemies, who made them suffer. In the time of their suffering, they cried out to you, and you heard them from heaven, and because of your great mercies you sent them rescuers who rescued them out of the hand of their enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_28" data-id="NH9_28">But after they had rest, they did evil again before you, and you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so their enemies ruled over them. Yet when they returned and cried out to you, you heard from heaven, and many times because of your compassion you rescued them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_29" data-id="NH9_29">You warned them so they might turn back to your law. Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to your commands. They sinned against your decrees which give life to anyone who obeys them. They gave the stubborn shoulder-blade and stiffened their neck and refused to listen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_30" data-id="NH9_30">For many years you put up with them and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they did not listen. So you gave them into the hand of the neighboring peoples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_31" data-id="NH9_31">But in your great mercies you did not make a complete end of them, or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_32" data-id="NH9_32">Now therefore, our God—you great, mighty, and awesome God who keep your covenant and steadfast love—do not let all this hardship seem little to you that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our ancestors, and on all your people from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_33" data-id="NH9_33">You are just in everything that has come on us, for you have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_34" data-id="NH9_34">Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our ancestors have not kept your law, nor paid attention to your commandments or your covenant decrees by which you warned them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_35" data-id="NH9_35">Even in their own kingdom, while they enjoyed your great goodness to them, in the large and productive land you set before them, they did not serve you or turn away from their evil ways.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_36" data-id="NH9_36">Now we are slaves in the land you gave our ancestors to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts, and behold, we are slaves in it!</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_37" data-id="NH9_37">The rich yield from our land goes to the kings you have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they please. We are in great distress.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH9_38" data-id="NH9_38">Because of all this, we make a firm covenant in writing. On the sealed document are the names of our princes, Levites, and priests."</span>
