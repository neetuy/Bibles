<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_3" data-id="ER10_3">So now let us make a covenant with our God to send out all the women and their children according to the Lord's instructions and the instructions of those who tremble at the commandments of our God, and let it be done according to the law.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_12" data-id="ER10_12">All the assembly answered in a loud voice, "We will do as you have said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_13" data-id="ER10_13">However, there are many people, and it is the rainy season.

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_14" data-id="ER10_14">So let our officials represent all the assembly.

<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_17" data-id="ER10_17">By the first day of the first month they had finished discovering which men had lived with foreign women.</span>
