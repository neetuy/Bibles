<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_1" data-id="AC16_1">Paul also came to Derbe and to Lystra; and behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who believed; his father was a Greek.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_2" data-id="AC16_2">He was well spoken of by the brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_3" data-id="AC16_3">Paul wanted him to travel with him; so he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_4" data-id="AC16_4">As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to the churches the instructions for them to obey, the instructions that had been written by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_5" data-id="AC16_5">So the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in number daily.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_6" data-id="AC16_6">Paul and his companions went through the regions of Phrygia and Galatia, since they had been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the word in the province of Asia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_7" data-id="AC16_7">When they came near Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus prevented them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_8" data-id="AC16_8">So passing by Mysia, they came down to the city of Troas.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_9" data-id="AC16_9">A vision appeared to Paul in the night: A man of Macedonia was standing there, calling him and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_10" data-id="AC16_10">When Paul had seen the vision, immediately we set out to go to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the gospel to them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_11" data-id="AC16_11">Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day we came to Neapolis.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_12" data-id="AC16_12">From there we went to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the most important city in the district and a Roman colony, and we stayed in this city for several days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_13" data-id="AC16_13">On the Sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where we thought there would be a place of prayer. We sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_14" data-id="AC16_14">A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, listened to us. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_15" data-id="AC16_15">When she and her house were baptized, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay in house." And she persuaded us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_16" data-id="AC16_16">It came about that, as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain young woman who had a spirit of divination encountered us. She brought her masters much gain by fortunetelling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_17" data-id="AC16_17">This woman followed after Paul and us and shouted, saying, "These men are servants of the Most High God. They proclaim to you the way of salvation."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_18" data-id="AC16_18">She did this for many days. But Paul, being greatly annoyed by her, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out right away.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_19" data-id="AC16_19">When her masters saw that their opportunity to make money was now gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_20" data-id="AC16_20">When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These men are stirring up our city. They are Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_21" data-id="AC16_21">They proclaim customs that are not lawful for Romans to accept or practice."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_22" data-id="AC16_22">Then the crowd rose up together against Paul and Silas; the magistrates tore their garments off them and commanded them to be beaten with rods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_23" data-id="AC16_23">When they had laid many blows upon them, they threw them into prison and commanded the jailer to keep them securely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_24" data-id="AC16_24">After he got this command, the jailer threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_25" data-id="AC16_25">Around midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_26" data-id="AC16_26">Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains were unfastened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_27" data-id="AC16_27">The jailer was awakened from sleep and saw the open prison doors; he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, because he thought that the prisoners had escaped.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_28" data-id="AC16_28">But Paul shouted with a loud voice, saying, "Do not harm yourself, because we are all here."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_29" data-id="AC16_29">The jailer called for lights and rushed in and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_30" data-id="AC16_30">and brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_31" data-id="AC16_31">They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your house."</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_32" data-id="AC16_32">They spoke the word of the Lord to him, together with everyone in his house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_33" data-id="AC16_33">Then the jailer took them at the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he and those in his entire house were baptized immediately.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_34" data-id="AC16_34">Then as he brought Paul and Silas up into his house and he set food before them, he rejoiced greatly with those of his house, that he had believed in God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_35" data-id="AC16_35">Now when it was day, the magistrates sent word to the guards, saying, "Let those men go."</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_36" data-id="AC16_36">The jailer reported the words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent word to me to let you go. Now therefore come out, and go in peace."</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_37" data-id="AC16_37">But Paul said to them, "They have publicly beaten us without a trial, even through we are Romans citizensâ€”and they threw us into prison. Do they now want to send us away secretly? No! Let them come themselves and lead us out."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_38" data-id="AC16_38">The guards reported these words to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans, they were afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_39" data-id="AC16_39">The magistrates came and apologized to them and brought them out, asking them them to go away from the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_40" data-id="AC16_40">So Paul and Silas went out of the prison and came to the house of Lydia. When Paul and Silas saw the brothers, they encouraged them and then departed from the city.</span>
