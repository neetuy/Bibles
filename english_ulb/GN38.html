<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_1" data-id="GN38_1">It came about at that time that Judah left his brothers and stayed with a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_2" data-id="GN38_2">He met there a daughter of a Canaanite man whose name was Shua. He took her and he went in to her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_3" data-id="GN38_3">She became pregnant and had a son. He was named Er.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_4" data-id="GN38_4">She became pregnant again and had a son. She called his name Onan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_5" data-id="GN38_5">She again had a son and called his name Shelah. It was at Kezib where she gave birth to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_6" data-id="GN38_6">Judah found a wife for Er, his firstborn. Her name was Tamar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_7" data-id="GN38_7">Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Yahweh. Yahweh killed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_8" data-id="GN38_8">Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife. Do the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up a child for your brother."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_9" data-id="GN38_9">Onan knew that the child would not be his. Whenever he went in to his brother's wife, he spilled the semen on the ground so he would not have a child for his brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_10" data-id="GN38_10">What he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh. Yahweh killed him also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_11" data-id="GN38_11">Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house until Shelah, my son, grows up." For he feared, "He might also die, just like his brothers." Tamar left and lived in her father's house.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_12" data-id="GN38_12">After a long time, Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_13" data-id="GN38_13">Tamar was told, "Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_14" data-id="GN38_14">She took off the clothing of her widowhood and covered herself with her veil and wrapped herself. She sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah had grown up but she had not been given to him as a wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_15" data-id="GN38_15">When Judah saw her he thought that she was a prostitute because she had covered her face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_16" data-id="GN38_16">He went to her by the road and said, "Come, please let me lie with you"—for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law—and she said, "What will you give me so you can lie with me?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_17" data-id="GN38_17">He said, "I will send you a young goat from the flock." She said, "Will you give me a pledge until you send it?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_18" data-id="GN38_18">He said, "What pledge can I give you?" She replied, "Your seal and cord, and the staff that is in your hand." He gave them to her and he went in to her, and she became pregnant by him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_19" data-id="GN38_19">She got up and went away. She took off her veil and put on the clothing of her widowhood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_20" data-id="GN38_20">Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order that he might receive the pledge back from the woman's hand, but he did not find her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_21" data-id="GN38_21">Then the Adullamite asked the men of the place, "Where is the cultic prostitute who was at Enaim by the road?" They said, "There has not been a cultic prostitute here."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_22" data-id="GN38_22">He returned to Judah and said, "I did not find her. Also, the men of the place said, 'There has not been a cultic prostitute here.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_23" data-id="GN38_23">Judah said, "Let her keep the things, that we not be put to shame. Indeed, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_24" data-id="GN38_24">It came about after about three months that it was told to Judah, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has committed prostitution, and indeed, she is pregnant by it." Judah said, "Bring her here and let her be burned."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_25" data-id="GN38_25">When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law a message, "By the man who owns these I am pregnant." She said, "Determine please whose these are, the seal and cords and staff."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_26" data-id="GN38_26">Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I am, since I did not give her as a wife to Shelah, my son." He did not lie with her again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_27" data-id="GN38_27">It came about at the time for her to give birth that, behold, twins were in her womb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_28" data-id="GN38_28">It came about as she was giving birth one put out a hand, and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his hand and said, "This one came out first."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_29" data-id="GN38_29">But then he drew back his hand, and, behold, his brother came out first. The midwife said, "How you have broken out!" So he was named Perez.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN38_30" data-id="GN38_30">Then his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread upon his hand, and he was named Zerah.</span>
