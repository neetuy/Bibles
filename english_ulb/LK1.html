<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_3" data-id="LK1_3">So it seemed good to me also, because I have accurately investigated everything from the beginning, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_4" data-id="LK1_4">so that you might know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_5" data-id="LK1_5">In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zechariah, from the division of Abijah. His wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_6" data-id="LK1_6">They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_7" data-id="LK1_7">But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both very old by this time.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_8" data-id="LK1_8">Now it came about that Zechariah was in God's presence, carrying out the priestly duties in the order of his division.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_9" data-id="LK1_9">According to the customary way of choosing which priest would serve, he had been chosen by lot to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_10" data-id="LK1_10">The whole crowd of people was praying outside at the hour when the incense was burned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_11" data-id="LK1_11">Now an angel of the Lord appeared to him and stood at the right side of the incense altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_12" data-id="LK1_12">When Zechariah saw him, he was terrified and fear fell on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_13" data-id="LK1_13">But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son. You will call his name John.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_14" data-id="LK1_14">You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_15" data-id="LK1_15">For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_16" data-id="LK1_16">Many of the people of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_17" data-id="LK1_17">He will go before the face of the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteousâ€”to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_18" data-id="LK1_18">Zechariah said to the angel, "How can I know this? For I am an old man and my wife is very old."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_19" data-id="LK1_19">The angel answered and said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, to bring you this gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_20" data-id="LK1_20">Behold! You will be silent, unable to speak, until the day these things take place. This is because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the right time."</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_21" data-id="LK1_21">Now the people were waiting for Zechariah. They were surprised that he was spending so much time in the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_22" data-id="LK1_22">But when he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized that he had seen a vision while he was in the temple. He kept on making signs to them and remained silent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_23" data-id="LK1_23">It came about that when the days of his service were over, he went to his house.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_24" data-id="LK1_24">After these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived and for five months she kept herself hidden. She said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_28" data-id="LK1_28">He came to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_29" data-id="LK1_29">But she was very confused by his words and she wondered what kind of greeting this could be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_30" data-id="LK1_30">The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_34" data-id="LK1_34">Mary said to the angel, "How will this happen, since I have not known any man?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_35" data-id="LK1_35">The angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will come over you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_36" data-id="LK1_36">See, your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age. This is the sixth month for her, she who was called barren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_37" data-id="LK1_37">For nothing will be impossible for God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_38" data-id="LK1_38">Mary said, "See, I am the female servant of the Lord. Let it be for me according to your message." Then the angel left her.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_39" data-id="LK1_39">Then Mary arose in those days and quickly went into the hill country, to a city in Judea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_40" data-id="LK1_40">She went into the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_41" data-id="LK1_41">Now it happened that when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby in her womb jumped, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_42" data-id="LK1_42">She raised her voice and said loudly, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</span>
