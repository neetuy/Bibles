<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_1" data-id="EC2_1">I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with happiness. So enjoy pleasure." But look, this also was just a temporary breeze.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_2" data-id="EC2_2">I said about laughter, "It is crazy," and about pleasure, "What use is it?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_3" data-id="EC2_3">I explored in my heart how to gratify my desires with wine. I let my mind guide me with wisdom although I was still holding on to folly. I wanted to find out what is good for people to do under heaven during the days of their lives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_4" data-id="EC2_4">I accomplished great things. I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_5" data-id="EC2_5">I built for myself gardens and parks; I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_6" data-id="EC2_6">I created pools of water to water a forest where trees were grown.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_7" data-id="EC2_7">I purchased male slaves and female slaves; I had slaves born in my palace. I also had large herds and flocks of livestock, much more than any king who ruled before me in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_8" data-id="EC2_8">I also accumulated for myself silver and gold, the treasures of kings and provinces. I got male and female singers for myself—the delights of the children of humanity—and many concubines. <span class="note" id="footnote-113"><a href="#note-113" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_9" data-id="EC2_9">So I became greater and wealthier than all who were before me in Jerusalem, and my wisdom remained with me.</span>

<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_10" data-id="EC2_10">Whatever my eyes desired,</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_10" data-id="EC2_10">I did not withhold from them.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_10" data-id="EC2_10">I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_10" data-id="EC2_10">because my heart rejoiced in all my labor</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_10" data-id="EC2_10">and pleasure was my reward for all my work.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_11" data-id="EC2_11">Then I looked on all the deeds that my hands had accomplished,</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_11" data-id="EC2_11">and on the work that I had done,</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_11" data-id="EC2_11">but again, everything was vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_11" data-id="EC2_11">There was no profit under the sun in it.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_12" data-id="EC2_12">Then I turned to consider wisdom,</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_12" data-id="EC2_12">and also madness and folly.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_12" data-id="EC2_12">For what can the next king do who comes after the king,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_12" data-id="EC2_12">which has not already been done?</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_13" data-id="EC2_13">Then I began to understand</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_13" data-id="EC2_13">that wisdom has advantages over folly,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_13" data-id="EC2_13">just as light is better than darkness.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_14" data-id="EC2_14">The wise man uses his eyes in his head to see where he is going,</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_14" data-id="EC2_14">but the fool walks in darkness,</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_14" data-id="EC2_14">although I know the same event happens to all of them.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">Then I said in my heart,</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">"What happens to the fool,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">will also happen to me.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">So what difference does it make if I am very wise?"</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">I concluded in my heart,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">"This too is only vapor."</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_16" data-id="EC2_16">For the wise man, like the fool, is not remembered for very long.</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_16" data-id="EC2_16">In the days to come everything will have been long forgotten.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_16" data-id="EC2_16">The wise man dies just like the fool dies.</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_17" data-id="EC2_17">So I detested life because all the work done under the sun was evil to me. This was because everything is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_18" data-id="EC2_18">I hated all my accomplishments for which I had worked under the sun because I must leave them behind to the man who comes after me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_19" data-id="EC2_19">For who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will be master over everything under the sun that my work and wisdom have built. This also is vapor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_20" data-id="EC2_20">Therefore my heart began to despair over all the work under the sun that I did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_21" data-id="EC2_21">For there might be someone who works with wisdom, with knowledge, and skill, but he will leave everything he has to a man who has not made any of it. This also is vapor and a great tragedy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_22" data-id="EC2_22">For what profit does the person gain who works so hard and tries in his heart to complete his labors under the sun?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_23" data-id="EC2_23">Every day his work is painful and stressful, so at night his soul does not find rest. This also is vapor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_24" data-id="EC2_24">There is nothing better for anyone than to simply eat and drink and be satisfied with what is good in his work. I saw that this truth comes from God's hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_25" data-id="EC2_25">For who can eat or who can have any kind of pleasure apart from God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_26" data-id="EC2_26">For to anyone who pleases him, God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy. However, to the sinner he gives the work of gathering and storing up so that he may give it away to someone who pleases God. This also amounts to vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.</span>
