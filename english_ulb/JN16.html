<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_2" data-id="JN16_2">They will throw you out of the synagogues. But the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering a service to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_3" data-id="JN16_3">They will do these things because they have not known the Father nor me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_4" data-id="JN16_4">I have spoken these things to you so that when their hour comes, you will remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you about these things in the beginning, because I was with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_5" data-id="JN16_5">But now I go to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_6" data-id="JN16_6">But because I have said these things to you, sadness has filled your heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_7" data-id="JN16_7">But truly I tell you, it is better for you that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_8" data-id="JN16_8">When he comes, the Comforter will prove the world to be wrong about sin, about righteousness, and about judgmentâ€”</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_9" data-id="JN16_9">about sin, because they do not believe in me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_10" data-id="JN16_10">about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will no longer see me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_11" data-id="JN16_11">and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_12" data-id="JN16_12">I have many things to say to you, but you would not understand them now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_13" data-id="JN16_13">But when he, the Spirit of Truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak from himself. But he will say whatever he hears, and he will tell you things that are to come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_14" data-id="JN16_14">He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and he will tell it to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_15" data-id="JN16_15">Everything that the Father has is mine. Therefore, I said that the Spirit will take from what is mine and he will tell it to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_16" data-id="JN16_16">In a short amount of time you will no longer see me, and after another short amount of time you will see me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_17" data-id="JN16_17">Then some of his disciples said to one another, "What is this that he says to us, 'A short amount of time you will no longer see me and after another short amount of time you will see me,' and, 'Because I go to the Father'?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_18" data-id="JN16_18">Therefore they said, "What is this that he says, 'A short amount of time'? We do not know what he is talking about."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_19" data-id="JN16_19">Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, "Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, 'A little while and you will no longer see me, and again a little while and you will see me'?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_20" data-id="JN16_20">Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will be glad. You will become full of sadness, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_21" data-id="JN16_21">When a woman gives birth she has sadness because her hour has come, but when she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers her pain because of her joy that a man has been born into the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_22" data-id="JN16_22">So you have sadness now, but I will see you again, and your heart will be glad, and no one will be able to take away your joy from you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_23" data-id="JN16_23">On that day you will not ask me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_24" data-id="JN16_24">Until now you have not asked anything in my name. Ask, and you will receive so that your joy will be fulfilled.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_25" data-id="JN16_25">I have said these things to you in figures of speech, but the hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but instead I will tell you plainly about the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_26" data-id="JN16_26">On that day you will ask in my name and I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_27" data-id="JN16_27">for the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and because you have believed that I came from the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_28" data-id="JN16_28">I came from the Father, and I have come into the world. Again, I am leaving the world and I am going to the Father."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_29" data-id="JN16_29">His disciples said, "See, now you are speaking plainly and you are not using figures of speech.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_30" data-id="JN16_30">Now we know that you know all things, and you do not need anyone to ask you questions. Because of this, we believe that you have come from God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_31" data-id="JN16_31">Jesus answered them, "Do you believe now?</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_32" data-id="JN16_32">See, the hour is coming, yes, and has indeed come, when you will be scattered, everyone to his own home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_33" data-id="JN16_33">I have spoken these things to you so that you will have peace in me. In the world you have troubles, but have courage, I have conquered the world."</span>
