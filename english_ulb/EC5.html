<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_1" data-id="EC5_1">Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not understand that they are doing what is wrong.</span>

<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">God is in heaven, but you are on earth,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">so let your words be few.</div>

Do not say to the priest's messenger, "That vow was a mistake." Why make God angry by vowing falsely, provoking God to destroy the work of your hands?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_7" data-id="EC5_7">For in many dreams, as in many words, there is meaningless vapor. So fear God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_8" data-id="EC5_8">When you see the poor being oppressed and robbed of just and right treatment in your province, do not be astonished as if no one knows, because there are people in power who watch those under them, and there are even higher ones over them.</span>
