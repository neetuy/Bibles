<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_2" data-id="EX21_2">'If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve for six years, and in the seventh year he will go free without paying anything.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_3" data-id="EX21_3">If he came by himself, he must go free by himself; if he is married, then his wife must go free with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_4" data-id="EX21_4">If his master gave him a wife and she bore him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will belong to her master, and he must go free by himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_5" data-id="EX21_5">But if the servant plainly says, "I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_6" data-id="EX21_6">then his master must bring him to God. The master must bring him to a door or doorpost, and his master must bore his ear through with an awl. Then the servant will serve him for life.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_7" data-id="EX21_7">If a man sells his daughter as a female servant, she must not go free as the male servants do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_8" data-id="EX21_8">If she does not please her master, who has designated her for himself, then he must let her be bought back. He has no right to sell her to a foreign people. He has no such right, since he has treated her deceitfully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_9" data-id="EX21_9">If her master designates her as a wife for his son, he must treat her the same as if she were his daughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_10" data-id="EX21_10">If he takes another wife for himself, he must not diminish her food, clothing, or her marital rights.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_11" data-id="EX21_11">But if he does not provide these three things for her, then she can go free without paying any money.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_19" data-id="EX21_19">then if he recovers and is able to walk about using his staff, the man who struck him must pay for the loss of his time; he must also pay for his complete recovery. But that man is not guilty of murder.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_20" data-id="EX21_20">If a man hits his male servant or his female servant with a staff, and if the servant dies as a result of the blow, then that man must surely be punished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_21" data-id="EX21_21">However, if the servant lives for a day or two, the master must not be punished, for he will have suffered the loss of the servant.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_23" data-id="EX21_23">But if there is serious injury, then you must give a life for a life,</span>
