<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_6" data-id="AC4_6">Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and all who were relatives of the high priest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_7" data-id="AC4_7">When they had set Peter and John in their midst, they asked them, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_8" data-id="AC4_8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders,</span>

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_14" data-id="AC4_14">Because they saw the man who was healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_15" data-id="AC4_15">But after they had commanded the apostles to leave the council meeting, they talked among themselves.</span>
