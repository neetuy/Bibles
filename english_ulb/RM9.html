<div class="c">9</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_1" data-id="RM9_1">I tell the truth in Christ. I do not lie, and my conscience bears witness with me in the Holy Spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_2" data-id="RM9_2">that for me there is great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_3" data-id="RM9_3">For I could wish that I myself would be cursed and set apart from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race according to the flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_4" data-id="RM9_4">They are Israelites. They have adoption, the glory, the covenants, the gift of the law, the worship of God, and the promises.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_5" data-id="RM9_5">Theirs are the ancestors from whom Christ has come with respect to the flesh—he who is God over all. May he be praised forever. Amen.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_6" data-id="RM9_6">But it is not as though the promises of God have failed. For it is not everyone in Israel who truly belongs to Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_7" data-id="RM9_7">Neither are all Abraham's descendants truly his children. But, "It is through Isaac that your descendants will be called."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_8" data-id="RM9_8">That is, the children of the flesh are not the children of God. But the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_9" data-id="RM9_9">For this is the word of promise: "At this time I will come, and a son will be given to Sarah."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_10" data-id="RM9_10">Not only this, but after Rebekah also had conceived by one man, our father Isaac—</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_11" data-id="RM9_11">for the children were not yet born and had not yet done anything good or bad, so that the purpose of God according to choice might stand, not because of actions, but because of him who calls—</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_12" data-id="RM9_12">it was said to her, "The older will serve the younger."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_13" data-id="RM9_13">It is just as had been written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_14" data-id="RM9_14">What then will we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_15" data-id="RM9_15">For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_16" data-id="RM9_16">So then, it is not because of him who wills, nor because of him who runs, but because of God, who shows mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_17" data-id="RM9_17">For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I raised you up, so that I might demonstrate my power in you, and so that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_18" data-id="RM9_18">So then, God has mercy on whom he wishes, and whom he wishes, he makes stubborn.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_19" data-id="RM9_19">You will say then to me, "Why does he still find fault? For who has ever withstood his will?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_20" data-id="RM9_20">On the contrary, man, who are you who answers against God? Will what has been molded say to the one who molds it, "Why did you make me this way?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_21" data-id="RM9_21">Does the potter not have the right over the clay to make from the same lump a container for special use, and another container for daily use?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_22" data-id="RM9_22">What if God, who is willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience containers of wrath prepared for destruction?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_23" data-id="RM9_23">What if he did this in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon containers of mercy, which he had previously prepared for glory?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_24" data-id="RM9_24">What if he did this also for us, whom he also called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_25" data-id="RM9_25">As he says also in Hosea:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_25" data-id="RM9_25">"I will call my people who were not my people,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_25" data-id="RM9_25">and her beloved who was not beloved.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_26" data-id="RM9_26">Then it will be that where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,'</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_26" data-id="RM9_26">there they will be called 'sons of the living God.'"</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_27" data-id="RM9_27">Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_27" data-id="RM9_27">"Though the number of the children of Israel were as the sand of the sea,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_27" data-id="RM9_27">it will be a remnant that will be saved,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_28" data-id="RM9_28">for the Lord will carry out his sentence on the earth,</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_28" data-id="RM9_28">completely and without delay."</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_29" data-id="RM9_29">As Isaiah had said previously,</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_29" data-id="RM9_29">"If the Lord of hosts had not left us descendants,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_29" data-id="RM9_29">we would be like Sodom,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_29" data-id="RM9_29">and we would have become like Gomorrah."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_30" data-id="RM9_30">What will we say then? That the Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, obtained righteousness, the righteousness by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_31" data-id="RM9_31">But Israel, who did pursue a law of righteousness, did not arrive at it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_32" data-id="RM9_32">Why not? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but by works. They stumbled over the stone of stumbling,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_33" data-id="RM9_33">as it has been written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_33" data-id="RM9_33">"Look, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_33" data-id="RM9_33">He who believes in it will not be ashamed."</div>
