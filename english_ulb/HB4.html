<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_1" data-id="HB4_1">Therefore, let us be very careful so that none of you might seem to have failed to reach the promise left behind for you to enter God's rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_2" data-id="HB4_2">For we were told the good news just as they were. But that message did not benefit those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed. <span class="note" id="footnote-316"><a href="#note-316" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">For we who have believed enter that rest, just as he said,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">"As I swore in my wrath,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">They will never enter my rest."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">Even so, his works were finished from the foundation of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_4" data-id="HB4_4">For he has somewhere spoken about the seventh day:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_4" data-id="HB4_4">"And God rested on the seventh day from all his works."</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_5" data-id="HB4_5">And again in this same passage he said,</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_5" data-id="HB4_5">"They will never enter my rest."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_6" data-id="HB4_6">Therefore, because it still remains that some will enter his rest, and those who previously had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in, because of their disobedience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_7" data-id="HB4_7">God has again set a certain day calling it "Today." After many days, he spoke through David, as it was earlier said,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_7" data-id="HB4_7">"Today if you hear his voice,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_7" data-id="HB4_7">do not harden your hearts."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_8" data-id="HB4_8">For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken about another day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_9" data-id="HB4_9">Therefore there is still a Sabbath rest reserved for God's people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_10" data-id="HB4_10">For he who enters into God's rest has himself also rested from his deeds, just as God did from his.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_11" data-id="HB4_11">Therefore let us be eager to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the kind of disobedience that they did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_12" data-id="HB4_12">For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. It pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_13" data-id="HB4_13">Nothing created is hidden before God. Instead, everything is bare and open to the eyes of the one to whom we must give account.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_14" data-id="HB4_14">Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us firmly hold to our beliefs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_15" data-id="HB4_15">For we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses. Instead, we have someone who has in all ways been tempted as we are, except that he is without sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_16" data-id="HB4_16">Let us then go with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</span>
