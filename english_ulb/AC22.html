<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_25" data-id="AC22_25">When they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and who has not been put on trial?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_26" data-id="AC22_26">When the centurion heard this, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_27" data-id="AC22_27">The chief captain came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" Paul said, "Yes."</span>

<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_30" data-id="AC22_30">On the next day, the chief captain wanted to know the truth about the Jews' accusations against Paul.
