<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S221_3" data-id="S221_3">So King David called together the Gibeonites and said to them, "What should I do for you? How can I make atonement, so that you may bless the people of Yahweh, who inherit his goodness and promises?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S221_4" data-id="S221_4">The Gibeonites responded to him, "It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his family. In the same way it is not for us to put to death any man in Israel." David replied, "What are you saying that I should do for you?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S221_5" data-id="S221_5">They answered the king, "The man who tried to kill us all, who schemed against us, so that we are now destroyed and have no place within the borders of Israel—</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S221_6" data-id="S221_6">let seven men from his descendants be handed over to us, and we will hang them before Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the one chosen by Yahweh." So the king said, "I will give them to you."</span>
