<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_1" data-id="C24_1">Therefore, because we have this ministry, and just as we have received mercy, we do not become discouraged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_2" data-id="C24_2">Instead, we have rejected secret and shameful ways. We do not live by craftiness, and we do not mishandle the word of God. By presenting the truth, we recommend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_3" data-id="C24_3">But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_4" data-id="C24_4">In their case, the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds. As a result, they are not able to see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_5" data-id="C24_5">For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_6" data-id="C24_6">For God is the one who said, "Light will shine out of darkness." He has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the presence of Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_7" data-id="C24_7">But we have this treasure in jars of clay, so that it is clear that the exceedingly great power belongs to God and not to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_8" data-id="C24_8">We are afflicted in every way, but not overwhelmed. We are perplexed but not filled with despair.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_9" data-id="C24_9">We are persecuted but not forsaken. We are struck down but not destroyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_10" data-id="C24_10">We always carry in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be shown in our bodies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_11" data-id="C24_11">We who are alive are always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be shown in our body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_12" data-id="C24_12">So death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_13" data-id="C24_13">But we have the same spirit of faith according to that which was written: "I believed, and so I spoke." We also believe, and so we also speak,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_14" data-id="C24_14">because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_15" data-id="C24_15">Everything is for your sake so that, as grace is spread to many people, thanksgiving may increase to the glory of God.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_16" data-id="C24_16">So we do not become discouraged. Even though outwardly we are wasting away, inwardly we are being renewed day by day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_17" data-id="C24_17">For this momentary, light affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory that exceeds all measurement.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C24_18" data-id="C24_18">For we are not watching for things that are seen, but for things that are unseen. The things that we can see are temporary, but the things that are unseen are eternal.</span>
