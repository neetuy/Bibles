<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_2" data-id="K112_2">It happened that Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of this (for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), for Jeroboam had settled down in Egypt. <span class="note" id="footnote-30"><a href="#note-30" class="key">â€ </a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_3" data-id="K112_3">So they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam,</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_7" data-id="K112_7">They spoke to him and said, "If you will be a servant today to these people and serve them, and answer them by saying good words to them, then they will always be your servants."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_8" data-id="K112_8">But Rehoboam ignored the advice that the old men had given him and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_9" data-id="K112_9">He said to them, "What advice do you give me that we may answer the people who spoke to me and said, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_12" data-id="K112_12">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had instructed when he said, "Come back to me on the third day."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_16" data-id="K112_16">When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered him and said,</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v K112_16" data-id="K112_16">So Israel went back to their tents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_17" data-id="K112_17">But as for the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam became king over them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_18" data-id="K112_18">Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, who was over the forced laborers, but all Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam fled quickly in his chariot to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_19" data-id="K112_19">So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_20" data-id="K112_20">It happened that when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to their assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was no one who followed the family of David, except only the tribe of Judah.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_21" data-id="K112_21">When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin; there were 180,000 chosen men who were soldiers, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_22" data-id="K112_22">But the word of God came to Shemaiah, the man of God; it said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_23" data-id="K112_23">"Speak to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people; say,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_24" data-id="K112_24">'Yahweh says this: You must not attack or fight against your brothers the people of Israel. Each man must return to his home, for this thing has been made to happen by me.'" So they listened to the word of Yahweh and turned back and went their way, and they obeyed his word.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_25" data-id="K112_25">Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived there. He went out from there and built Peniel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_26" data-id="K112_26">Jeroboam thought in his heart, "Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_27" data-id="K112_27">If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the temple of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then the heart of these people will turn again to their master, to Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_28" data-id="K112_28">So King Jeroboam sought advice and made two calves of gold; he said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Look, these are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_29" data-id="K112_29">He set up one in Bethel and the other in Dan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_30" data-id="K112_30">So this act became a sin. The people went to one or the other, all the way to Dan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_31" data-id="K112_31">Jeroboam made houses on high places and he also made priests from among all the people, who were not among the sons of Levi.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_32" data-id="K112_32">Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar. He did so at Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made, and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places he had made.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v K112_33" data-id="K112_33">Jeroboam went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month he had planned in his own mind; he ordained a feast for the people of Israel and went up to the altar to burn incense.</span>
