<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_1" data-id="AC23_1">Paul looked directly at the council members and said, "Brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day."</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_2" data-id="AC23_2">The high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_3" data-id="AC23_3">Then said Paul to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall. Are you sitting to judge me by the law, yet order me to be struck, against the law?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_4" data-id="AC23_4">Those who stood by said, "Is this how you insult God's high priest?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_5" data-id="AC23_5">Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC23_5" data-id="AC23_5">You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_6" data-id="AC23_6">When Paul saw that the one part of the council were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he spoke loudly in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is because I have the certain hope of the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_7" data-id="AC23_7">When he said this, an argument began between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the crowd was divided.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_8" data-id="AC23_8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, no angels, and no spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge all of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_9" data-id="AC23_9">So a large uproar occurred, and some of the scribes belonging to the Pharisees stood up and argued, saying, "We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_10" data-id="AC23_10">When there arose a great argument, the chief captain feared that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, so he commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among the council members, and bring him into the fortress.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_11" data-id="AC23_11">The following night the Lord stood beside him and said, "Do not be afraid, for as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_12" data-id="AC23_12">When it became day, some Jews formed a conspiracy and called a curse down upon themselves with an oath not to eat nor drink anything until they had killed Paul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_13" data-id="AC23_13">There were more than forty men who formed this conspiracy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_14" data-id="AC23_14">They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, "We have put ourselves under a great curse, to eat nothing until we have killed Paul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_15" data-id="AC23_15">Now, therefore, let the council tell the chief captain to bring him down to you, as if you would decide his case more precisely. As for us, we are ready to kill him before he comes here."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_16" data-id="AC23_16">But Paul's sister's son heard that they were lying in wait, so he went and entered the fortress and told Paul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_17" data-id="AC23_17">Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the chief captain, for he has something to tell him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_18" data-id="AC23_18">So the centurion took the young man and brought him to the chief captain and said, "Paul the prisoner called me to him, and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_19" data-id="AC23_19">The chief captain took him by the hand to a private place and asked him, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_20" data-id="AC23_20">The young man said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring down Paul tomorrow to the council, as if they were going to ask more precisely about his case.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_21" data-id="AC23_21">But do not give in to them, because there are more than forty men who are lying in wait for him. They have called a curse down on themselves, neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Even now they are ready, waiting for consent from you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_22" data-id="AC23_22">So the chief captain let the young man go, after instructing him, "Tell no one that you have said these things to me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_23" data-id="AC23_23">Then he called to him two of the centurions and said, "Get two hundred soldiers ready to go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen also, and two hundred spearmen. You will leave at the third hour of the night."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_24" data-id="AC23_24">He also ordered them to provide animals which Paul could ride, and to take him safely to Felix the governor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_25" data-id="AC23_25">Then he wrote a letter like this:</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_26" data-id="AC23_26">"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent Governor Felix, greetings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_27" data-id="AC23_27">This man was arrested by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with soldiers and rescued him, since I learned that he was a Roman citizen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_28" data-id="AC23_28">I wanted to know why they accused him, so I took him down to their council.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_29" data-id="AC23_29">I learned that he was being accused about questions concerning their own law, but that there was no accusation against him that deserved death or imprisonment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_30" data-id="AC23_30">Then it was made known to me that there was a plot against the man, so I immediately sent him to you, and instructed his accusers also to bring their charges against him in your presence. Farewell."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_31" data-id="AC23_31">So the soldiers obeyed their orders. They took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_32" data-id="AC23_32">On the next day, most of the soldiers left the horsemen to go with him and they themselves returned to the fortress.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_33" data-id="AC23_33">When the horsemen reached Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_34" data-id="AC23_34">When the governor read the letter, he asked what province Paul was from. When he learned that he was from Cilicia,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC23_35" data-id="AC23_35">he said, "I will hear you fully when your accusers come here." Then he commanded him to be kept in Herod's government headquarters.</span>
