<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_1" data-id="RV5_1">Then I saw in the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne a scroll written on the front and on the back, sealed with seven seals.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_2" data-id="RV5_2">I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?"</span>

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_6" data-id="RV5_6">I saw a Lamb standing in the middle of the throne area and among the four living creatures and among the elders. He looked as though he had been killed. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_7" data-id="RV5_7">He went and took hold of the scroll out of the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_8" data-id="RV5_8">When he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each of them had a harp and a golden bowl full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">They sang a new song:</span>
