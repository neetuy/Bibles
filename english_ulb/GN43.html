<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_5" data-id="GN43_5">But if you do not send him, we will not go down. For the man said to us, 'You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_6" data-id="GN43_6">Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man that you had another brother?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_7" data-id="GN43_7">They said, "The man asked details about us and our family. He said, 'Is your father still alive?

<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_12" data-id="GN43_12">Take double money in your hand. The money that was returned in the opening of your sacks, carry again in your hand. Perhaps it was a mistake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_13" data-id="GN43_13">Take also your brother. Rise and go again to the man.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_18" data-id="GN43_18">The men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house. They said, "It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time we were brought in, that he may seek an opportunity against us. He might arrest us and take us as slaves, and take our donkeys."</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_20" data-id="GN43_20">saying, "My master, we came down the first time to buy food.</span>

We have brought it back in our hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_22" data-id="GN43_22">Other money we have also brought down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_23" data-id="GN43_23">The steward said, "Peace be to you, do not fear.

<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_24" data-id="GN43_24">The steward took the men into Joseph's house. He gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave feed to their donkeys.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_25" data-id="GN43_25">They prepared the gifts for Joseph's coming at noon, for they had heard that they would eat there.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_26" data-id="GN43_26">When Joseph came home, they brought the gifts which were in their hand into the house, and bowed down before him to the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_27" data-id="GN43_27">He asked them about their welfare and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_28" data-id="GN43_28">They said, "Your servant our father is well. He is still alive." They prostrated themselves and bowed down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_29" data-id="GN43_29">When he lifted up his eyes he saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and he said, "Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?"

<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_30" data-id="GN43_30">Joseph hurried to go out of the room, for he was deeply moved about his brother. He sought somewhere to weep. He went to his room and wept there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_31" data-id="GN43_31">He washed his face and came out. He controlled himself, saying, "Serve the food."</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_32" data-id="GN43_32">The servants served Joseph by himself and the brothers by themselves. The Egyptians there ate with him by themselves because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is detestable to the Egyptians.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_33" data-id="GN43_33">The brothers sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth. The men were astonished together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_34" data-id="GN43_34">Joseph sent portions to them from the food in front of him. But Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of his brothers. They drank and were merry with him.</span>
