<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_17" data-id="MK1_17">Jesus said to them, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_18" data-id="MK1_18">Then immediately they left the nets and followed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_19" data-id="MK1_19">As Jesus was walking on a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and John his brother; they were in the boat mending the nets.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_22" data-id="MK1_22">They were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as someone who has authority and not as the scribes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_23" data-id="MK1_23">Just then a man in their synagogue who had an unclean spirit cried out,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_24" data-id="MK1_24">saying, "What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_25" data-id="MK1_25">Jesus rebuked the demon and said, "Be quiet and come out of him!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_26" data-id="MK1_26">The unclean spirit threw him down and went out from him while crying out with a loud voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_27" data-id="MK1_27">All the people were amazed, so they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_28" data-id="MK1_28">The news about him went out everywhere into the whole region of Galilee.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_29" data-id="MK1_29">After coming out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_30" data-id="MK1_30">Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_31" data-id="MK1_31">So he came, took her by the hand, and raised her up; the fever left her, and she started serving them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_32" data-id="MK1_32">That evening, after the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed by demons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_33" data-id="MK1_33">The whole city gathered together at the door.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_34" data-id="MK1_34">He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons, but he did not allow the demons to speak because they knew him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_35" data-id="MK1_35">He got up very early, while it was still dark; he left and went out into a solitary place and there he prayed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_36" data-id="MK1_36">Simon and those who were with him searched for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_37" data-id="MK1_37">They found him and they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_38" data-id="MK1_38">He said, "Let us go elsewhere, out into the surrounding towns, so that I may preach there also. That is why I came out here."</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_39" data-id="MK1_39">He went throughout all of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_40" data-id="MK1_40">A leper came to him. He was begging him; he knelt down and said to him, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_41" data-id="MK1_41">Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying to him, "I am willing. Be clean."</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_42" data-id="MK1_42">Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_43" data-id="MK1_43">Jesus strictly warned him and sent him away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_44" data-id="MK1_44">He said to him, "Be sure to say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_45" data-id="MK1_45">But he went out and began to spread the news widely, so much that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but he stayed out in remote places. Yet people were still coming to him from everywhere.</span>
