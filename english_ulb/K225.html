He camped opposite it, and they built a siege wall around it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_2" data-id="K225_2">So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah's reign.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_3" data-id="K225_3">On the ninth day of the fourth month of that year, the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_4" data-id="K225_4">Then the city was broken into, and all the fighting men fled at night by the way of the gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, although the Chaldeans were all around the city. The king went in the direction of the Arabah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_5" data-id="K225_5">But the army of Chaldeans pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of the Jordan River valley near Jericho. All his army was scattered away from him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_6" data-id="K225_6">They captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they passed sentence on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_7" data-id="K225_7">As for Zedekiah's sons, they slaughtered them before his eyes. Then he put out his eyes, bound him in bronze chains, and brought him to Babylon.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_8" data-id="K225_8">Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, a servant of the king of Babylon and commander of his bodyguards, came to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_9" data-id="K225_9">He burned the house of Yahweh, the king's palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem; also every important building in the city he burned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_10" data-id="K225_10">As for all the walls around Jerusalem, all the army of the Babylonians who were under the commander of the bodyguard destroyed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_11" data-id="K225_11">As for the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the remainder of the population—Nebuzaradan, the commander of the bodyguard, took them away into exile.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_12" data-id="K225_12">But the commander of the bodyguard did leave some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_13" data-id="K225_13">As for the bronze pillars that were in the house of Yahweh, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh, the Chaldeans broke them into pieces and carried the bronze back to Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_14" data-id="K225_14">The pots, shovels, lamp trimmers, spoons, and all the utensils of bronze with which the priests had served in the temple—the Chaldeans took them all away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_15" data-id="K225_15">The pots for removing ashes and the bowls that were made of gold, and those made of silver—the captain of the king's guard took them away as well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_16" data-id="K225_16">The two pillars, the sea, and the stands that Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh contained more bronze than could be weighed.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_23" data-id="K225_23">Now when all the commanders of the soldiers, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah. These men were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maakathite—they and their men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_24" data-id="K225_24">Gedaliah made an oath to them and to their men, and said to them, "Do not be afraid of the Chaldean officials. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_25" data-id="K225_25">But it happened that in the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, from the royal family, came with ten men and attacked Gedaliah.

<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K225_26" data-id="K225_26">Then all the people, from the least to the greatest, and the commanders of the soldiers, arose and went to Egypt, because they were afraid of the Babylonians.</span>
