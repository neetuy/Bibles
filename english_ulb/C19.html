<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_1" data-id="C19_1">Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my workmanship in the Lord?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_2" data-id="C19_2">If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you. For you are the proof of my apostleship in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_3" data-id="C19_3">This is my defense to those who examine me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_4" data-id="C19_4">Do we not have the right to eat and drink?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_5" data-id="C19_5">Do we not have the right to take along with us a wife who is a believer, as do the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_6" data-id="C19_6">Or is it only Barnabas and I who must work?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_7" data-id="C19_7">Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink milk from it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_8" data-id="C19_8">Do I say these things based on human authority? Does not the law also say this?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_9" data-id="C19_9">For it is written in the law of Moses, "Do not put a muzzle on an ox when it is treading out the grain." Is it really the oxen that God cares about?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_10" data-id="C19_10">Is he not speaking about us? It was written for us, because the one who plows should plow in hope, and the one who threshes should thresh in the expectation of sharing in the harvest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_11" data-id="C19_11">If we sowed spiritual things among you, is it too much for us to reap material things from you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_12" data-id="C19_12">If others exercised this right from you, do we not have even more? But we did not claim this right. Instead we endured everything rather than be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_13" data-id="C19_13">Do you not know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple? Do you not know that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_14" data-id="C19_14">In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living from the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_15" data-id="C19_15">But I have not claimed any of these rights. And I do not write this so something might be done for me. I would rather die than anyone deprive me of this boast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_16" data-id="C19_16">For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason for boasting, because I must do this. And woe be to me if I do not preach the gospel!</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_17" data-id="C19_17">For if I do this willingly, I have a reward. But if not willingly, I still have a responsibility that was entrusted to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_18" data-id="C19_18">What then is my reward? That when I preach, I may offer the gospel without charge and so not take full use of my right in the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_19" data-id="C19_19">For though I am free from all, I became a servant to all, in order that I might win more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_20" data-id="C19_20">To the Jews I became like a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law, I became like one under the law in order to win those under the law. I did this even though I myself was not under the law. <span class="note" id="footnote-288"><a href="#note-288" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_21" data-id="C19_21">To those outside the law, I became like one outside the law, although I was not outside the law of God myself, but under the law of Christ. I did this so that I may win those outside the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_22" data-id="C19_22">To the weak I became weak, so that I may win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that I may by all means save some.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_23" data-id="C19_23">I do all things for the gospel's sake, so that I may participate in its blessings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_24" data-id="C19_24">Do you not know that in a race all the runners run the race, but that only one receives the prize? So run to win the prize.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_25" data-id="C19_25">Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a wreath that is perishable, but we do it to receive one that is imperishable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_26" data-id="C19_26">Therefore I do not run without purpose or box by beating the air.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_27" data-id="C19_27">But I subdue my body and make it a slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself may not be disqualified.</span>
