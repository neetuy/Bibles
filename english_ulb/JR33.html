<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_3" data-id="JR33_3">'Call to me, and I will answer you. I will demonstrate great things to you, mysteries that you do not understand.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_4" data-id="JR33_4">For Yahweh, God of Israel, says this concerning the houses in this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that are torn down because of the siege ramps and the sword,</span>
