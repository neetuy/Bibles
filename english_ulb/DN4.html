<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_4" data-id="DN4_4">I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living happily in my house, and I was enjoying prosperity in my palace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_5" data-id="DN4_5">But a dream I had made me afraid. As I lay there, the images I saw and the visions in my mind troubled me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_6" data-id="DN4_6">So I gave a decree to bring before me all the men of Babylon who had wisdom so they could interpret the dream for me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_7" data-id="DN4_7">Then came the magicians, those who claimed to speak with the dead, the wise men, and the astrologers. I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_8" data-id="DN4_8">But at last Daniel came in—the one who is named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods—and I told him the dream.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_9" data-id="DN4_9">"Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is too difficult for you. Tell me what I saw in my dream and what it means.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_10" data-id="DN4_10">These were the sights that I saw in my mind as I lay upon my bed: I looked, and there was a tree in the middle of the earth, and its height was very great.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_11" data-id="DN4_11">The tree grew and became strong. Its top reached to the heavens, and it could be seen to the ends of the whole earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_12" data-id="DN4_12">Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit was abundant, and on it was food for all. The wild animals found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its branches. All living creatures were fed from it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_13" data-id="DN4_13">I saw in my mind as I lay on my bed, and a holy messenger came down from the heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_14" data-id="DN4_14">He shouted and said, 'Chop down the tree and cut off its branches, strip off its leaves, and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds fly away from its branches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_15" data-id="DN4_15">Leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the middle of the tender grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew from the heavens. Let it live with the animals among the plants on the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_16" data-id="DN4_16">Let his mind be changed from a man's mind, and let an animal's mind be given to him until seven years pass by.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_17" data-id="DN4_17">This decision is by the decree reported by the messenger. It is a decision made by the holy ones so that those who are alive may know that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of people and gives them to anyone he wishes to place over them, even to the most humble men.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_18" data-id="DN4_18">I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had this dream. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because none of the men with wisdom in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you are able to do so, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_19" data-id="DN4_19">Then Daniel, who was also named Belteshazzar, was greatly upset for a while, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, "Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you." Belteshazzar replied, "My master, may the dream be for those who hate you; may its interpretation be for your enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_20" data-id="DN4_20">The tree that you saw—which grew and became strong, and whose top reached up to the heavens, and which could be seen to the ends of the whole earth—</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_21" data-id="DN4_21">whose leaves were beautiful, and whose fruit was abundant, so that in it was food for all, and under it the animals of the field found shade, and in which the birds of the heavens lived—</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_22" data-id="DN4_22">this tree is you, king, you who have grown so strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to the heavens, and your authority reaches to the ends of the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_23" data-id="DN4_23">You, king, saw a holy messenger coming down from heaven and saying, 'Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the middle of the tender grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew from the heavens. Let it live with the wild animals in the fields until seven years pass by.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_24" data-id="DN4_24">This is the interpretation, king. It is a decree of the Most High that has reached you, my master the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_25" data-id="DN4_25">You will be driven from among men, and you will live with the wild animals in the fields. You will be made to eat grass like an ox, and you will be wet with the dew from the heavens, and seven years will pass by until you acknowledge that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of people and that he gives them to anyone he wishes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_26" data-id="DN4_26">As it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, in this way your kingdom will be returned to you from the time you learn that heaven rules.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_27" data-id="DN4_27">Therefore, king, let my advice be acceptable to you. Stop sinning and do what is right. Turn away from your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, and it may be that your prosperity will be extended."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_28" data-id="DN4_28">All these things happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_29" data-id="DN4_29">Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_30" data-id="DN4_30">and he said, "Is this not the great Babylon, which I have built for my royal residence, for the glory of my majesty?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_31" data-id="DN4_31">While the words were still on the lips of the king, a voice came from heaven: "King Nebuchadnezzar, it is announced to you that this kingdom has been taken away from you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_32" data-id="DN4_32">You will be driven away from people, and your home will be with the wild animals in the fields. You will be made to eat grass like an ox. Seven years will pass until you acknowledge that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of people and he gives them to anyone he wishes."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_33" data-id="DN4_33">This decree against Nebuchadnezzar was carried out immediately. He was driven away from people. He ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew from the heavens. His hair grew as long as eagles' feathers, and his nails became like birds' claws.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_34" data-id="DN4_34">At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was given back to me.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN4_34" data-id="DN4_34">"I praised the Most High,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN4_34" data-id="DN4_34">and I honored and glorified the one who lives forever.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN4_34" data-id="DN4_34">For his reign is an everlasting reign,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN4_34" data-id="DN4_34">and his kingdom endures from all generations to all generations.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_35" data-id="DN4_35">All the earth's inhabitants are considered by him to be as nothing;</span>

<span class="v DN4_35" data-id="DN4_35">whatever suits his will.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN4_35" data-id="DN4_35">No one can stop him or challenge him. No one can say to him, 'Why have you done this?'"</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_36" data-id="DN4_36">At the same time that my sanity returned to me, my majesty and splendor returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My counselors and my noblemen sought my favor. I was brought back to my throne, and even more greatness was given to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_37" data-id="DN4_37">Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, extol, and honor the King of heaven, for all his deeds are right, and his ways are just. He can humble those who walk in their own pride.</span>
