<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_1" data-id="RM8_1">There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_2" data-id="RM8_2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_3" data-id="RM8_3">For what the law was unable to do because it was weak through the flesh, God did. He sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be an offering for sin, and he condemned sin in the flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_4" data-id="RM8_4">He did this in order that the requirements of the law might be fulfilled in us, we who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_5" data-id="RM8_5">Those who live according to the flesh pay attention to the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit pay attention to the things of the Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_6" data-id="RM8_6">For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_7" data-id="RM8_7">The mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God, for it is not subject to God's law, nor is it able to do so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_8" data-id="RM8_8">Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_9" data-id="RM8_9">However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is true that God's Spirit lives in you. But if someone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_10" data-id="RM8_10">If Christ is in you, the body is dead with respect to sin, but the spirit is alive with respect to righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_11" data-id="RM8_11">If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_12" data-id="RM8_12">So then, brothers, we are debtors, but not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_13" data-id="RM8_13">For if you live according to the flesh, you are about to die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the body's actions, you will live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_14" data-id="RM8_14">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_15" data-id="RM8_15">You did not receive a spirit that makes you slaves, so that you live in fear again; but you received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, "Abba, Father!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_16" data-id="RM8_16">The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_17" data-id="RM8_17">If we are children, then we are also heirs, heirs of God. And we are joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_18" data-id="RM8_18">For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_19" data-id="RM8_19">For the eager expectation of the creation waits for the revealing of the sons of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_20" data-id="RM8_20">For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in the certain hope</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_21" data-id="RM8_21">that the creation itself will be delivered from slavery to decay, and that it will be brought into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_22" data-id="RM8_22">For we know that the whole creation groans and labors in pain together even now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_23" data-id="RM8_23">Not only that, but even we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit—even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, the redemption of our body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_24" data-id="RM8_24">For in this certain hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he can see?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_25" data-id="RM8_25">But if we have certain hope about what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_26" data-id="RM8_26">In the same way, the Spirit also helps in our weakness. For we do not know how we should pray, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_27" data-id="RM8_27">He who searches the hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes on behalf of the saints according to the will of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_28" data-id="RM8_28">We know that for those who love God, he works all things together for good, <span class="note" id="footnote-283"><a href="#note-283" class="key">†</a></span> for those who are called according to his purpose.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_29" data-id="RM8_29">Because those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_30" data-id="RM8_30">Those whom he predestined, these he also called. Those whom he called, these he also justified. Those whom he justified, these he also glorified.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_31" data-id="RM8_31">What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_32" data-id="RM8_32">He who did not spare his own Son but delivered him up on behalf of us all, how will he not also with him freely give us all things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_33" data-id="RM8_33">Who will bring any accusation against God's chosen ones? God is the one who justifies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_34" data-id="RM8_34">Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, and who also is interceding for us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_35" data-id="RM8_35">Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_36" data-id="RM8_36">Just as it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM8_36" data-id="RM8_36">"For your benefit we are killed all day long.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM8_36" data-id="RM8_36">We were considered as sheep for the slaughter."</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_37" data-id="RM8_37">In all these things we are more than conquerors through the one who loved us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_38" data-id="RM8_38">For I have been convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor governments, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_39" data-id="RM8_39">nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
