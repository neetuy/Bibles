<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_2" data-id="EK13_2">"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets who are prophesying in Israel, and say to those who are prophesying out of their own imaginations, 'Listen to the word of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_3" data-id="EK13_3">The Lord Yahweh says this: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, but who have seen nothing!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_4" data-id="EK13_4">Israel, your prophets have been like jackals in the wastelands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_5" data-id="EK13_5">You have not gone to the breaks in the wall around the house of Israel in order to repair it, in order to resist in battle on the day of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_6" data-id="EK13_6">The people have false visions and make false predictions, those who say, "Such and such is Yahweh's declaration."

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_7" data-id="EK13_7">Have you not had false visions and made false predictions, you who say, "Such and such is Yahweh's declaration" when I myself have not spoken?'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_8" data-id="EK13_8">Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, 'Because you have had false visions and have told lies—therefore this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration against you:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_9" data-id="EK13_9">My hand will be against the prophets who have lying visions and who make false predictions. They will not be in the assembly of my people, or enrolled in the record of the house of Israel; they must not go to the land of Israel. For you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_10" data-id="EK13_10">Because of this, and because they led my people astray and said, "Peace!" when there is no peace, they are building a wall that they will paint with whitewash.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_13" data-id="EK13_13">Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: I will bring a windstorm in my rage, and there will be floods of rain in my wrath! Hailstones in my rage will completely destroy it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_16" data-id="EK13_16">the prophets of Israel who prophesied about Jerusalem and who had visions of peace for her. But there is no peace!—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."'</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_21" data-id="EK13_21">I will tear away your veils and rescue my people from your hand, so they will no longer be trapped in your hands. You will know that I am Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_22" data-id="EK13_22">Because you discourage the heart of the righteous person with lies, even though I did not desire his discouragement, and because you encourage instead the actions of the wicked person so that he will not turn from his way to save his life—</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK13_23" data-id="EK13_23">therefore you will no longer have false visions or continue to make predictions, for I will rescue my people out of your hand. You will know that I am Yahweh.'"</span>
