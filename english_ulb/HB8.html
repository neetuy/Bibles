<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_1" data-id="HB8_1">Now the point of what we are saying is this: We have a high priest who has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_2" data-id="HB8_2">He is a servant in the holy place, the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_3" data-id="HB8_3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary to have something to offer.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_7" data-id="HB8_7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_8" data-id="HB8_8">For when God found fault with the people, he said,</span>
