<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_4" data-id="AC11_4">But Peter started to explain the matter to them in detail; he said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_5" data-id="AC11_5">I was praying in the city of Joppa, and I had a vision of a container coming down, like a large sheet let down from heaven by its four corners. It descended to me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_24" data-id="AC11_24">For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.</span>
