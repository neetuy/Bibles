<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN27_2" data-id="GN27_2">He said, "See here, I am old. I do not know the day of my death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN27_3" data-id="GN27_3">Therefore take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN27_4" data-id="GN27_4">Make delicious food for me, the sort that I love, and bring it to me so I can eat it and bless you before I die."</span>

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN27_5" data-id="GN27_5">Now Rebekah heard it when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN27_6" data-id="GN27_6">Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son and said, "See here, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother. He said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN27_8" data-id="GN27_8">Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN27_9" data-id="GN27_9">Go to the flock, and bring me two good young goats; and I will make delicious food from them for your father, just like he loves.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN27_11" data-id="GN27_11">Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "See, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN27_14" data-id="GN27_14">So Jacob went and got the young goats and brought them to his mother, and his mother made delicious food, just like his father loved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN27_15" data-id="GN27_15">Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau, her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.</span>
