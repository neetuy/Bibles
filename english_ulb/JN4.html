<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_1" data-id="JN4_1">Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_2" data-id="JN4_2">(although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were),</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_3" data-id="JN4_3">he left Judea and went back again to Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_4" data-id="JN4_4">But it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_5" data-id="JN4_5">So he came to a town of Samaria, called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_6" data-id="JN4_6">The well of Jacob was there. Jesus was tired from his journey and sat by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_7" data-id="JN4_7">A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, "Give me some water to drink."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_8" data-id="JN4_8">For his disciples had gone away into the town to buy food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_9" data-id="JN4_9">Then the Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it that you, being a Jew, are asking me, being a Samaritan woman, for something to drink?" For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_10" data-id="JN4_10">Jesus answered and said to her, "If you had known the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_11" data-id="JN4_11">The woman said to him, "Sir, you do not have a bucket and the well is deep. Where then do you have the living water?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_12" data-id="JN4_12">You are not greater, are you, than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his cattle?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_13" data-id="JN4_13">Jesus replied and said to her, "Everyone who drinks from this water will be thirsty again,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_14" data-id="JN4_14">but whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. Instead, the water that I will give him will become a fountain of water in him, springing up to eternal life."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_15" data-id="JN4_15">The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I may not become thirsty and not have to come here to draw water."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_16" data-id="JN4_16">Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come back here."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_17" data-id="JN4_17">The woman answered and said to him, "I do not have a husband." Jesus replied, "You are right in saying, 'I have no husband,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_18" data-id="JN4_18">for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_19" data-id="JN4_19">The woman said to him, "Sir, I see that you are a prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_20" data-id="JN4_20">Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is the place where people have to worship."</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_21" data-id="JN4_21">Jesus said to her, "Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_22" data-id="JN4_22">You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_23" data-id="JN4_23">However, the hour is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to be his worshipers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_24" data-id="JN4_24">God is Spirit, and the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_25" data-id="JN4_25">The woman said to him, "I know that the Messiah is coming (the one called Christ). When he comes, he will explain everything to us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_26" data-id="JN4_26">Jesus said to her, "I am he, the one speaking to you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_27" data-id="JN4_27">At that moment his disciples returned. Now they were wondering why he was speaking with a woman, but no one said, "What do you want?" or "Why are you speaking with her?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_28" data-id="JN4_28">So the woman left her water pot, went back to the town, and said to the people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_29" data-id="JN4_29">"Come, see a man who told me everything that I have ever done. This could not be the Christ, could it?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_30" data-id="JN4_30">They left the town and came to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_31" data-id="JN4_31">In the meantime, the disciples were urging him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_32" data-id="JN4_32">But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know about."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_33" data-id="JN4_33">So the disciples said to each other, "No one has brought him anything to eat, have they?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_34" data-id="JN4_34">Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_35" data-id="JN4_35">Do you not say, 'There are four more months and then the harvest comes'? I am saying to you, look up and see the fields, for they are already ripe for harvest!</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_36" data-id="JN4_36">He who is harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for everlasting life, so that he who sows and he who harvests may rejoice together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_37" data-id="JN4_37">For in this the saying, 'One sows, and another harvests,' is true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_38" data-id="JN4_38">I sent you to harvest what you have not worked for. Others have worked, and you have entered into their labor."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_39" data-id="JN4_39">Many of the Samaritans in that city believed in him because of the report of the woman who was testifying, "He told me everything that I have done."</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_40" data-id="JN4_40">So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_41" data-id="JN4_41">Many more believed because of his word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_42" data-id="JN4_42">They said to the woman, "We no longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is indeed the savior of the world."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_43" data-id="JN4_43">After those two days, he departed from there for Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_44" data-id="JN4_44">For Jesus himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_45" data-id="JN4_45">When he came into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all the things that he had done in Jerusalem at the festival, for they had also gone to the festival.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_46" data-id="JN4_46">Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. There was a certain royal official whose son in Capernaum was ill.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_47" data-id="JN4_47">When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to Jesus and asked him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_48" data-id="JN4_48">Jesus then said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe."</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_49" data-id="JN4_49">The official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_50" data-id="JN4_50">Jesus said to him, "Go. Your son lives." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_51" data-id="JN4_51">While he was going down, his servants met him, saying that his son was living.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_52" data-id="JN4_52">So he asked them the hour when he began to improve. They replied to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_53" data-id="JN4_53">Then the father realized that it was at that hour that Jesus had said to him, "Your son lives." So he himself and his whole household believed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54 " data-id="bibleJsn">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_54" data-id="JN4_54">This was the second sign that Jesus did when he came out of Judea to Galilee.</span>
