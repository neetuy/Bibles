<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_1" data-id="MT25_1">Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_2" data-id="MT25_2">Five of them were foolish and five were wise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_3" data-id="MT25_3">For when the foolish virgins took their lamps, they did not take any oil with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_4" data-id="MT25_4">But the wise virgins took containers of oil along with their lamps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_5" data-id="MT25_5">Now while the bridegroom was delayed, they all got sleepy and slept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_6" data-id="MT25_6">But at midnight there was a cry, 'Look, the bridegroom! Go out and meet him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_7" data-id="MT25_7">Then all those virgins rose up and trimmed their lamps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_8" data-id="MT25_8">The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_9" data-id="MT25_9">But the wise answered and said, 'Since there will not be enough for us and you, go instead to those who sell and buy some for yourselves.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_10" data-id="MT25_10">While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_11" data-id="MT25_11">Afterward the other virgins also came and said, 'Master, master, open for us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_12" data-id="MT25_12">But he answered and said, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_13" data-id="MT25_13">Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_14" data-id="MT25_14">For it is like when a man was about to go into another country. He called his own servants and gave over to them his wealth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_15" data-id="MT25_15">To one of them he gave five talents, to another he gave two, and to yet another he gave one talent. Each one received an amount according to his own ability, and that man went on his journey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_16" data-id="MT25_16">The one who received the five talents went at once and invested them and made another five talents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_17" data-id="MT25_17">Likewise the one who had received two talents made another two.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_18" data-id="MT25_18">But the servant who had received one talent went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_19" data-id="MT25_19">Now after a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_20" data-id="MT25_20">The servant who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents. He said, 'Master, you gave me five talents. See, I have made five talents more.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_21" data-id="MT25_21">His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_22" data-id="MT25_22">The servant who had received two talents came and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made two more talents.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_23" data-id="MT25_23">His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_24" data-id="MT25_24">Then the servant who had received one talent came and said, 'Master, I know that you are a strict man. You reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_25" data-id="MT25_25">I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have here what belongs to you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_26" data-id="MT25_26">But his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_27" data-id="MT25_27">Therefore you should have given my money to the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_28" data-id="MT25_28">Therefore take away the talent from him and give it to the servant who has ten talents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_29" data-id="MT25_29">For to everyone who possesses, more will be givenâ€”even more abundantly. But from anyone who does not possess anything, even what he does have will be taken away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_30" data-id="MT25_30">Throw the worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_31" data-id="MT25_31">When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_32" data-id="MT25_32">Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate the people one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_33" data-id="MT25_33">He will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_34" data-id="MT25_34">Then the King will say to those on his right hand, 'Come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_35" data-id="MT25_35">For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me a drink; I was a stranger and you took me in;</span>

<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_37" data-id="MT25_37">Then the righteous will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you a drink?</span>

<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_40" data-id="MT25_40">Then the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, what you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it for me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_41" data-id="MT25_41">Then he will say to those on his left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_42" data-id="MT25_42">because I was hungry, but you did not give me food; I was thirsty, but you did not give me a drink;</span>

<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_44" data-id="MT25_44">Then they will also answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not serve you?'</span>
