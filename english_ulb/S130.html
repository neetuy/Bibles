<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S130_2" data-id="S130_2">and captured the women and everyone who was in it, both small and great. They killed no one, but carried them off as they went on their way.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S130_7" data-id="S130_7">David said to Abiathar son of Ahimelech, the priest, "I beg you, bring the ephod here for me." Abiathar brought the ephod to David.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S130_23" data-id="S130_23">Then David said, "You must not act like this, my brothers, with what Yahweh has given to us. He has preserved us and given into our hand the raiders who came against us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S130_24" data-id="S130_24">Who will listen to you in this matter? For as the share is for anyone who goes into battle, so also will the share be for anyone who waits by the baggage; they will share and share alike."</span>
