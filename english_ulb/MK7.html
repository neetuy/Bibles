<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_4" data-id="MK7_4">When the Pharisees come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they bathe themselves, and they hold fast to many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pots, copper vessels, and the couches upon which they eat.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_5" data-id="MK7_5">The Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, "Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, for they eat their bread with unwashed hands?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_6" data-id="MK7_6">But he said to them, "Isaiah prophesied well about you hypocrites. He wrote,</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_9" data-id="MK7_9">He also said to them, "How well you reject the commandment of God so you may keep your tradition!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_10" data-id="MK7_10">For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of his father or mother will surely die.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_19" data-id="MK7_19">because it cannot go into his heart, but it goes into his stomach and then passes out into the latrine?" With this statement Jesus declared all foods clean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_20" data-id="MK7_20">He said, "It is that which comes out of the person that defiles him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_25" data-id="MK7_25">In fact <span class="note" id="footnote-241"><a href="#note-241" class="key">†</a></span> , as soon a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him, she came and fell down at his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_26" data-id="MK7_26">Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by descent. She begged him to cast out the demon from her daughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_27" data-id="MK7_27">He said to her, "Let the children first be fed. For it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_28" data-id="MK7_28">But she answered and said to him, "Yes, Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_29" data-id="MK7_29">He said to her, "Because you have said this, you are free to go. The demon has gone out of your daughter."</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_30" data-id="MK7_30">She went back to her house and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_31" data-id="MK7_31">Then he went out again from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee up into the region of the Decapolis.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_32" data-id="MK7_32">They brought to him someone who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they begged him to lay his hand on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_33" data-id="MK7_33">He took him aside from the crowd privately, and he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_34" data-id="MK7_34">He looked up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, "Ephphatha," that is to say, "Open!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_35" data-id="MK7_35">At once his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he began to speak plainly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_36" data-id="MK7_36">Jesus ordered them to tell no one. But the more he ordered them, the more abundantly they proclaimed it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_37" data-id="MK7_37">They were extremely astonished, saying, "He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."</span>
