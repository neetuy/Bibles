<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_2" data-id="JS14_2">Their inheritance was selected by lot for the nine and one-half tribes, just as Yahweh had commanded by the hand of Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_3" data-id="JS14_3">For Moses had given the inheritance of the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_4" data-id="JS14_4">The tribe of Joseph was actually two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites were given no portion of the inheritance in the land, but only certain cities to live in, with their pasturelands for livestock and for their own material resources.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_5" data-id="JS14_5">The people of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses, so they assigned the land.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_7" data-id="JS14_7">I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy on the land. I brought him a report again as it was in my heart to make.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_8" data-id="JS14_8">But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear. But I completely followed Yahweh my God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_9" data-id="JS14_9">Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has walked will be an inheritance for you and for your children forever, because you have completely followed Yahweh my God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_10" data-id="JS14_10">Now, look! Yahweh has kept me alive these forty-five years, just as he saidâ€”from the time when Yahweh spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. Now, look! I am this day eighty-five years old.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_11" data-id="JS14_11">I am still as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me out. My strength is now as my strength was then, for war and for going and coming.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_12" data-id="JS14_12">Now therefore give me this hill country, which Yahweh promised me on that day. For you heard on that day that the Anakim were there with great fortified cities. It may be that Yahweh will be with me and that I will drive them out, just as Yahweh said."</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_13" data-id="JS14_13">Then Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron as an inheritance to Caleb son of Jephunneh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_14" data-id="JS14_14">Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he completely followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>
