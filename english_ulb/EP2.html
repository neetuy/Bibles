<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_1" data-id="EP2_1">And as for you, you were dead in your trespasses and sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_2" data-id="EP2_2">It was in these trespasses and sins that you once lived according to the ways of this world. You were living according to the ruler of the authorities of the air, the spirit that is working in the sons of disobedience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_3" data-id="EP2_3">Once we all lived among these people, fulfilling the evil desires of our sinful nature, and carrying out the desires of the body and of the mind. We were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of humanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_4" data-id="EP2_4">But God is rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_5" data-id="EP2_5">While we were dead in trespasses, he made us alive together in Christâ€”by grace you have been saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_6" data-id="EP2_6">God raised us up together with Christ, and God made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_7" data-id="EP2_7">so that in the ages to come he might show to us the immeasurably great riches of his grace expressed in his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_8" data-id="EP2_8">For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this did not come from you, it is the gift of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_9" data-id="EP2_9">not from works and so no one may boast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_10" data-id="EP2_10">For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good deeds that God planned long ago for us, so that we would walk in them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_11" data-id="EP2_11">Therefore remember that once you were Gentiles in the flesh. You are called "uncircumcision" by what is called the "circumcision" in the flesh made by human hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_12" data-id="EP2_12">For at that time you were separated from Christ, foreigners to the people of Israel, strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_13" data-id="EP2_13">But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away from God have been brought near by the blood of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_14" data-id="EP2_14">For he is our peace. He made the two one. By his flesh he destroyed the wall of hostility that divided us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_15" data-id="EP2_15">That is, he abolished the law of commandments and regulations so that he might create one new man in himself, and so making peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_16" data-id="EP2_16">Christ reconciles both peoples into one body to God through the cross, putting to death the hostility.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_17" data-id="EP2_17">Jesus came and proclaimed peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_18" data-id="EP2_18">For through Jesus we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_19" data-id="EP2_19">So then, now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. Instead you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of God's household.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_20" data-id="EP2_20">You have been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, and Christ Jesus himself was the cornerstone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_21" data-id="EP2_21">In him the whole building fits together and grows as a temple in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_22" data-id="EP2_22">It is in him that you also are being built together as a dwelling place for God in the Spirit.</span>
