<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_1" data-id="JN11_1">Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_2" data-id="JN11_2">It was Mary who anointed the Lord with myrrh and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_3" data-id="JN11_3">The sisters then sent for Jesus, saying, "Lord, see, he whom you love is sick."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_4" data-id="JN11_4">When Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is not to death, but instead it is for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorified by it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_5" data-id="JN11_5">Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_6" data-id="JN11_6">So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, Jesus stayed two more days in the place where he was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_7" data-id="JN11_7">Then after this, he said to the disciples, "Let us go to Judea again."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_8" data-id="JN11_8">The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, right now the Jews are trying to stone you, and you are going back there again?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_9" data-id="JN11_9">Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of light in a day? If someone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_10" data-id="JN11_10">However, if he walks at night, he will stumble because the light is not in him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_11" data-id="JN11_11">He said these things, and after these things, he said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may wake him out of sleep."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_12" data-id="JN11_12">The disciples therefore said to him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_13" data-id="JN11_13">Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he was speaking about the sleep of resting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_14" data-id="JN11_14">Then Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_15" data-id="JN11_15">I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there so that you may believe. Let us go to him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_16" data-id="JN11_16">Thomas, who was called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go so that we may die with Jesus."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_17" data-id="JN11_17">When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_18" data-id="JN11_18">Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_19" data-id="JN11_19">Many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them about their brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_20" data-id="JN11_20">Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_21" data-id="JN11_21">Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_22" data-id="JN11_22">Even now, I know that whatever you ask from God, he will give to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_23" data-id="JN11_23">Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_24" data-id="JN11_24">Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_25" data-id="JN11_25">Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, even if he dies, will live;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_26" data-id="JN11_26">and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_27" data-id="JN11_27">She said to him, "Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_28" data-id="JN11_28">When she had said this, she went away and called her sister Mary privately. She said, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_29" data-id="JN11_29">When she heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_30" data-id="JN11_30">Now Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_31" data-id="JN11_31">So when the Jews, who were with her in the house and who were comforting her, saw Mary getting up quickly and going out, they followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_32" data-id="JN11_32">When Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet and said to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_33" data-id="JN11_33">When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and was troubled;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_34" data-id="JN11_34">he said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to him, "Lord, come and see."</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_35" data-id="JN11_35">Jesus wept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_36" data-id="JN11_36">Then the Jews said, "See how much he loved Lazarus!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_37" data-id="JN11_37">But some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of a blind man, also have made this man not die?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_38" data-id="JN11_38">Then Jesus again, being deeply moved in himself, went to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_39" data-id="JN11_39">Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of Lazarus, the one who had died, said to Jesus, "Lord, by this time the body will be decaying, for he has been dead for four days."</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_40" data-id="JN11_40">Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that, if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_41" data-id="JN11_41">So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank you that you listened to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_42" data-id="JN11_42">I knew that you always listen to me, but it is because of the crowd that is standing around me that I said this, so that they may believe that you have sent me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_43" data-id="JN11_43">After he had said this, he cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_44" data-id="JN11_44">The dead man came out; his feet and hands were bound with cloths, and his face was bound about with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Untie him and let him go."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_45" data-id="JN11_45">Then many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_46" data-id="JN11_46">But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_47" data-id="JN11_47">Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council together and said, "What will we do? This man does many signs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_48" data-id="JN11_48">If we leave him alone like this, all will believe in him; the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_49" data-id="JN11_49">However, a certain man among them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_50" data-id="JN11_50">You do not consider that it is better for you that one man dies for the people than that the whole nation perishes."</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_51" data-id="JN11_51">Now this he said not from himself. Instead, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_52" data-id="JN11_52">and not only for the nation, but so that the children of God who are scattered would be gathered together into one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_53" data-id="JN11_53">So from that day onward they planned how to put Jesus to death.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-54 " data-id="bibleJsn">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_54" data-id="JN11_54">No longer did Jesus walk openly among the Jews, but he departed from there into the country near to the wilderness into a town called Ephraim. There he stayed with the disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55 " data-id="bibleJsn">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_55" data-id="JN11_55">Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover in order to purify themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56 " data-id="bibleJsn">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_56" data-id="JN11_56">They were looking for Jesus, and speaking one with another as they stood in the temple, "What do you think? That he will not come to the festival?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-57 " data-id="bibleJsn">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_57" data-id="JN11_57">Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given an order that if anyone knew where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might seize him.</span>
