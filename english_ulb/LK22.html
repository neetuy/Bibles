<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_1" data-id="LK22_1">Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread was approaching, which is called the Passover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_2" data-id="LK22_2">The chief priests and the scribes discussed how they could put Jesus to death, for they were afraid of the people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_3" data-id="LK22_3">Then Satan entered into Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_4" data-id="LK22_4">Judas went to the chief priests and captains and discussed with them how he would betray Jesus to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_5" data-id="LK22_5">They were glad, and agreed to give him money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_6" data-id="LK22_6">He consented, and looked for an opportunity to deliver him to them away from the crowd.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_7" data-id="LK22_7">Then came the day of unleavened bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_8" data-id="LK22_8">So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare for us the Passover meal, so that we may eat it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_9" data-id="LK22_9">They said to him, "Where do you want us to make preparations?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_10" data-id="LK22_10">He answered them, "Listen, when you have entered the city, a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he goes into.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_11" data-id="LK22_11">Then say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room, where I will eat the Passover with my disciples?"'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_12" data-id="LK22_12">He will show you a large furnished upper room. Make the preparations there."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_13" data-id="LK22_13">So they went, and found everything as he had said to them. Then they prepared the Passover meal.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_14" data-id="LK22_14">When the time came, he sat down with the apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_15" data-id="LK22_15">Then he said to them, "I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_16" data-id="LK22_16">For I say to you, I will not eat it again, until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_17" data-id="LK22_17">Then Jesus took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, "Take this, and share it among yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_18" data-id="LK22_18">For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again until the kingdom of God comes."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_19" data-id="LK22_19">Then he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_20" data-id="LK22_20">He took the cup in the same way after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_21" data-id="LK22_21">But pay attention. The one who betrays me is with me at the table.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_22" data-id="LK22_22">For the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined. But woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_23" data-id="LK22_23">They began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who would do this.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_24" data-id="LK22_24">Then there arose also a quarrel among them about which of them was considered to be greatest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_25" data-id="LK22_25">He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles are masters over them, and the ones who have authority over them are referred to as those who do good to their people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_26" data-id="LK22_26">But it must not be like this with you. Instead, let the one who is the greatest among you become like the youngest, and let the one who is the most important become like the one who serves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_27" data-id="LK22_27">For who is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as one who serves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_28" data-id="LK22_28">But you are the ones who have continued with me in my temptations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_29" data-id="LK22_29">I give to you a kingdom, even as my Father has given a kingdom to me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_30" data-id="LK22_30">that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_31" data-id="LK22_31">Simon, Simon, be aware, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_32" data-id="LK22_32">But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. After you have turned back again, strengthen your brothers."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_33" data-id="LK22_33">Peter said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death."</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_34" data-id="LK22_34">Jesus replied, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, before you deny three times that you know me."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_35" data-id="LK22_35">Then Jesus said to them, "When I sent you out without a purse, a bag of provisions, or shoes, did you lack anything?" They answered, "Nothing."</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_36" data-id="LK22_36">Then he said to them, "But now, the one who has a purse, let him take it, and also a bag of provisions. The one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_37" data-id="LK22_37">For I say to you, what is written about me must be fulfilled, 'He was counted with the lawless ones.' For what is predicted about me is being fulfilled."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_38" data-id="LK22_38">Then they said, "Lord, look! Here are two swords." He said to them, "It is enough."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_39" data-id="LK22_39">Jesus went, as he often did, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_40" data-id="LK22_40">When they arrived, he said to them, "Pray that you do not enter into temptation."</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_41" data-id="LK22_41">He went away from them about a stone's throw, and he knelt down and prayed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_42" data-id="LK22_42">saying, "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless not my will, but yours be done."</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_43" data-id="LK22_43">Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_44" data-id="LK22_44">Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_45" data-id="LK22_45">When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of their sorrow,</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_46" data-id="LK22_46">and asked them, "Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray, that you may not enter into temptation."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_47" data-id="LK22_47">While he was still speaking, behold, a crowd appeared, with Judas, one of the twelve, leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_48" data-id="LK22_48">but Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_49" data-id="LK22_49">When those who were around Jesus saw what was happening, they said, "Lord, should we strike with the sword?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_50" data-id="LK22_50">Then one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_51" data-id="LK22_51">Jesus said, "That is enough!" He touched his ear, and healed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_52" data-id="LK22_52">Jesus said to the chief priests, to the captains of the temple, and to elders who came against him, "Do you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</span>
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_53" data-id="LK22_53">When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-54 " data-id="bibleJsn">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_54" data-id="LK22_54">Seizing him, they led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed from a distance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55 " data-id="bibleJsn">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_55" data-id="LK22_55">After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56 " data-id="bibleJsn">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_56" data-id="LK22_56">A certain female servant saw him as he sat in the light of the fire, and looked straight at him and said, "This man also was with him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-57 " data-id="bibleJsn">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_57" data-id="LK22_57">But Peter denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-58 " data-id="bibleJsn">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_58" data-id="LK22_58">After a little while someone else saw him, and said, "You are also one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."</span>
<span class="v-num v-59 " data-id="bibleJsn">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_59" data-id="LK22_59">After about an hour another man insisted and said, "Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean."</span>
<span class="v-num v-60 " data-id="bibleJsn">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_60" data-id="LK22_60">But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying." Immediately, while he was speaking, a rooster crowed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-61 " data-id="bibleJsn">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_61" data-id="LK22_61">Turning, the Lord looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, when he said to him, "Before a rooster crows today you will deny me three times."</span>
<span class="v-num v-62 " data-id="bibleJsn">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_62" data-id="LK22_62">Peter went outside and wept bitterly.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-63 " data-id="bibleJsn">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_63" data-id="LK22_63">Then the men guarding Jesus mocked and beat him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-64 " data-id="bibleJsn">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_64" data-id="LK22_64">They put a cover over him and asked him, saying, "Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-65 " data-id="bibleJsn">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_65" data-id="LK22_65">They spoke many other things against Jesus, blaspheming him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-66 " data-id="bibleJsn">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_66" data-id="LK22_66">As soon as it was day, the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. They led him into the council</span>
<span class="v-num v-67 " data-id="bibleJsn">67&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_67" data-id="LK22_67">and said, "If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe,</span>
<span class="v-num v-68 " data-id="bibleJsn">68&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_68" data-id="LK22_68">and if I ask you, you will not answer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-69 " data-id="bibleJsn">69&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_69" data-id="LK22_69">But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-70 " data-id="bibleJsn">70&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_70" data-id="LK22_70">They all said, "Then you are the Son of God?" Jesus said to them, "You say that I am."</span>
<span class="v-num v-71 " data-id="bibleJsn">71&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_71" data-id="LK22_71">They said, "Why do we still need a witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth."  </span>
