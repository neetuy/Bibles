<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_1" data-id="AC14_1">It came about in Iconium that Paul and Barnabas entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a way that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_2" data-id="AC14_2">But the Jews who were disobedient stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and made them bitter against the brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_3" data-id="AC14_3">So they stayed there for a long time, speaking boldly with the Lord's power, while he gave evidence about the message of his grace. He did this by granting signs and wonders to be done by the hands of Paul and Barnabas.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_4" data-id="AC14_4">But the majority of the city was divided: some people sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_5" data-id="AC14_5">When both Gentiles and Jews attempted to persuade their leaders to mistreat and stone Paul and Barnabas,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_6" data-id="AC14_6">they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_7" data-id="AC14_7">where they continued to proclaim the gospel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_8" data-id="AC14_8">At Lystra a certain man sat, powerless in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_9" data-id="AC14_9">This man heard Paul speaking. Paul fixed his eyes on him and saw that he had faith to be made well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_10" data-id="AC14_10">So he said to him in a loud voice, "Stand up on your feet." Then the man jumped up and walked around.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_11" data-id="AC14_11">When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the dialect of Lycaonia, "The gods have come down to us in the form of men."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_12" data-id="AC14_12">They called Barnabas "Zeus," and Paul, "Hermes," because he was the main speaker.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_13" data-id="AC14_13">The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and wreaths to the gates; he and the multitudes wanted to offer sacrifice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_14" data-id="AC14_14">But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothing and quickly went out into the crowd, crying out</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_15" data-id="AC14_15">and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things? We also are human beings with the same feelings as you. We bring you gospel, that you should turn from these useless things to a living God, who made the heavens, the earth, and the sea and everything that is in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_16" data-id="AC14_16">In the past ages, he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_17" data-id="AC14_17">But still, he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you the rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_18" data-id="AC14_18">Even with these words, Paul and Barnabas barely kept the multitudes from sacrificing to them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_19" data-id="AC14_19">But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came and persuaded the crowds. They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking that he was dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_20" data-id="AC14_20">Yet as the disciples were standing around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day, he went to Derbe with Barnabas.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_21" data-id="AC14_21">After they had proclaimed the gospel in that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_22" data-id="AC14_22">They kept strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith, saying, "We must enter into the kingdom of God through many sufferings."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_23" data-id="AC14_23">When they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_24" data-id="AC14_24">Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_25" data-id="AC14_25">When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_26" data-id="AC14_26">From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now completed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_27" data-id="AC14_27">When they arrived in Antioch and gathered the church together, they reported all the things that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_28" data-id="AC14_28">They stayed for a long time with the disciples.</span>
