<span class="v AC20_18" data-id="AC20_18">"You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I always spent my time with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_19" data-id="AC20_19">I kept serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind and with tears, and in sufferings that happened to me because of the plots of the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_20" data-id="AC20_20">You know how I did not keep back from declaring to you anything that was useful, and how I taught you in public and from house to house,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_21" data-id="AC20_21">testifying both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_22" data-id="AC20_22">Now look, I am going to Jerusalem, compelled by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_23" data-id="AC20_23">except that the Holy Spirit warns to me in every city that chains and sufferings await me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_24" data-id="AC20_24">But I do not consider my life is valuable to myself, if only I may finish the race and complete the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_25" data-id="AC20_25">Now look, I know that you all, among whom I went about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_26" data-id="AC20_26">Therefore I testify to you this day, that I am innocent of the blood of any man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_27" data-id="AC20_27">For I did not hold back from declaring to you the whole will of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_28" data-id="AC20_28">Therefore be careful about yourselves, and about all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.

<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_29" data-id="AC20_29">I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_30" data-id="AC20_30">I know that from even among you some men shall come and distort the truth in order to draw away the disciples after them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_31" data-id="AC20_31">So be on guard. Remember that for three years I did not stop instructing every one of you with tears night and day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_32" data-id="AC20_32">Now I entrust you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are being sanctified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_33" data-id="AC20_33">I coveted no man's silver, gold, or clothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_34" data-id="AC20_34">You yourselves know that these hands served my own needs and the needs of those who were with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_35" data-id="AC20_35">In all things I gave you an example of how you should help the weak by working, and of how you should remember the words of the Lord Jesus, words that he himself said: "It is more blessed to give than to receive."</span>

<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_37" data-id="AC20_37">There was a lot of crying and they embraced Paul and kissed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC20_38" data-id="AC20_38">They were sad most of all because of what he had said, that they would never see his face again. Then they escorted him to the ship.</span>
