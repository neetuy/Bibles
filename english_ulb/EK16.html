<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_4" data-id="EK16_4">On the day of your birth, your mother did not cut your navel, nor did she purify you in water or rub you down with salt, or wrap cloth around you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_7" data-id="EK16_7">I made you grow like a plant in a field. You multiplied and became great, and you became the jewel of jewels. Your breasts became firm, and your hair grew thick, though you had been naked and bare.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_8" data-id="EK16_8">I passed by you again, and I saw you. See! the time of love came for you, so I spread my robe over you and covered your nakedness. Then I swore to you and brought you into a covenant—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—and you became mine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_9" data-id="EK16_9">So I washed you with water and rinsed your blood off you, and I anointed you with oil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_10" data-id="EK16_10">I dressed you in embroidered clothes and placed leather sandals on your feet. I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_11" data-id="EK16_11">Next I adorned you with jewelry, and I put bracelets on your hands, and a chain around your neck.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_12" data-id="EK16_12">I put a nose ring in your nostrils and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_13" data-id="EK16_13">So you were adorned with gold and silver, and you were dressed in fine linen, silk, and embroidered clothes; you ate fine flour, honey, and oil, and you were very beautiful, and you became a queen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_14" data-id="EK16_14">Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect in the majesty that I had given to you—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_15" data-id="EK16_15">But you trusted in your own beauty, and you acted like a prostitute because of your fame; you poured out your acts of prostitution on everyone who passed by, so that your beauty became his.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_16" data-id="EK16_16">Then you took your clothes and with them you made high places for yourself decorated in various colors, and there you acted like a prostitute. This should not have happened. Nor should such a thing exist.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_17" data-id="EK16_17">You took the fine jewels of the gold and silver that I gave you, and you made for yourself male figures, and you did with them as a prostitute would do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_18" data-id="EK16_18">You took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set my oils and perfumes before them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_19" data-id="EK16_19">My bread I gave you—made with fine flour, oil, and honey—you set before them for a fragrant aroma, for this is what happened—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_20" data-id="EK16_20">Then you took your sons and daughters whom you bore for me, and you sacrificed them to the images to be devoured as food. Are your acts of prostitution a small matter?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_21" data-id="EK16_21">You slaughtered my children to the idols and made them pass through the fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_22" data-id="EK16_22">In all your abominations and your acts of prostitution you have not thought about the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare as you thrashed about in your blood.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_23" data-id="EK16_23">Woe! Woe to you!—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—therefore, in addition to all this wickedness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_24" data-id="EK16_24">you built yourself a mound and made yourself a lofty shrine in every public place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_25" data-id="EK16_25">You built your high place at the head of every road and made your beauty a disgrace, and you spread your legs to anyone who passed by, and you multiplied your acts of prostitution.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_26" data-id="EK16_26">You have acted like a prostitute with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and you committed many more acts of prostitution, provoking me to anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_27" data-id="EK16_27">See! I will strike you with my hand and cut off your food. I will hand your life over to your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your obscene behavior.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_28" data-id="EK16_28">You have acted like a prostitute with the Assyrians because you could not be satisfied. You acted like a prostitute and still were not satisfied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_29" data-id="EK16_29">You performed many more acts of prostitution in the land of the merchants of Chaldea, and even this did not satisfy you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_30" data-id="EK16_30">How sick is your heart—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—that you would do all these things, deeds of a shameless prostitute?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_31" data-id="EK16_31">You have built your mounds at the head of every street and made your lofty shrines in every public square. Yet you were not like a prostitute because you scoffed at taking payment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_32" data-id="EK16_32">You adulterous woman, you accept strangers instead of your husband.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_33" data-id="EK16_33">People give payment to every prostitute, but you give your wages to all your lovers and bribe them to come to you from all around for your acts of prostitution.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_34" data-id="EK16_34">So there is a difference between you and other women. No one offers payment for you to act as a prostitute. You are the very opposite. You gave them payment and none was given to you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_35" data-id="EK16_35">Therefore, you prostitute, listen to the word of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_36" data-id="EK16_36">The Lord Yahweh says this: Because you have poured out your lust and uncovered your nakedness through your acts of prostitution with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children's blood,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_37" data-id="EK16_37">therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers that you have met, all those whom you loved and all those whom you hated, and I will gather them against you on every side. I will uncover your nakedness to them so they see all your nakedness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_38" data-id="EK16_38">For I will punish you for adultery and the shedding of blood, and I will bring on you the bloodshed of my anger and passion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_39" data-id="EK16_39">I will give you into their hands so they will throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your high places and they will strip you of your clothes and take all of your jewelry. They will leave you naked and bare.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_40" data-id="EK16_40">Then they will bring up a crowd against you and stone you with stones, and they will cut you apart with their swords.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_41" data-id="EK16_41">They will burn your houses and will perform many acts of punishment on you in the sight of many women, for I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_42" data-id="EK16_42">Then I will calm my fury against you; my anger will leave you, for I will be satisfied, and will no longer be angry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_43" data-id="EK16_43">Because you did not call to mind the days of your youth and have made me shake with anger because of all these things, therefore, behold! I myself will bring down on your own head the punishment for what you have done—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration. Have you not added prostitution to all your other detestable practices?</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_44" data-id="EK16_44">Behold! Everyone who speaks proverbs concerning you will say, "As the mother is, so also is her daughter."</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_45" data-id="EK16_45">You are the daughter of your mother, who detested her husband and her children, and you are the sister of your sisters who detested their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father was an Amorite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_46" data-id="EK16_46">Your older sister was Samaria and her daughters were the ones living in the north, while your younger sister was the one living south of you, that is, Sodom and her daughters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_47" data-id="EK16_47">You not only walked in their ways and copied their behavior and practices, but in all your ways you have been worse than they were.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_48" data-id="EK16_48">As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—your sister Sodom and her daughters, have not done as much evil as you and your daughters have done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_49" data-id="EK16_49">Behold! This was the sin of your sister Sodom that she was arrogant in her leisure, careless and unconcerned about anything. She did not strengthen the hands of the poor and needy people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_50" data-id="EK16_50">She was arrogant and committed disgusting actions before me, so I took them away just as you have seen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_51" data-id="EK16_51">Neither did Samaria commit even half of your sins; instead, you have done many more disgusting things than they did, and you have shown that your sisters were better than you because of all the disgusting things that you do!</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_52" data-id="EK16_52">Especially you, show your own shame; in this way you have shown that your sisters were better than you, because of the sins you committed in all those disgusting ways. Your sisters now seem better than you. Especially you, show your own shame, for in this way you have shown that your sisters were better than you.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_53" data-id="EK16_53">For I will restore their fortunes—the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters; but your fortunes will be among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54 " data-id="bibleJsn">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_54" data-id="EK16_54">On account of these things you will show your shame; you will be humiliated because of everything that you have done, and in this way you will be a comfort to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55 " data-id="bibleJsn">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK16_55" data-id="EK16_55">So your sister Sodom and her daughters will be restored to their former condition, and Samaria and her daughters will be restored to their former estate.
