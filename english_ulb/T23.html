<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_1" data-id="T23_1">But know this, that in the last days there will be difficult times.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_2" data-id="T23_2">For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, and unholy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_3" data-id="T23_3">without natural affection, unable to reconcile, slanderers, without self-control, violent, not lovers of good,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_4" data-id="T23_4">betrayers, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_5" data-id="T23_5">They will have a shape of godliness, but they will deny the power of it. So turn away from these people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_6" data-id="T23_6">For among them are people who are entering into households and captivating foolish women who are heaped up with sins and are led away by various desires,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_7" data-id="T23_7">always learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_8" data-id="T23_8">In the same manner that Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these people oppose the truth, people corrupted in their mind, and disqualified with regard to the faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_9" data-id="T23_9">But they will not advance very far, for their foolishness will be obvious to all, just as also that of those men became.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_10" data-id="T23_10">But you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_11" data-id="T23_11">persecutions, sufferings, and what happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra; what manner of persecutions I endured. And yet, the Lord rescued me from them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_12" data-id="T23_12">And indeed all those who want to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_13" data-id="T23_13">But evil people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and being deceived.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_14" data-id="T23_14">You, however, continue in the things that you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you have learned them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_15" data-id="T23_15">and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_16" data-id="T23_16">All scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_17" data-id="T23_17">so that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.</span>
