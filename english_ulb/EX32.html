As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_2" data-id="EX32_2">So Aaron said to them, "Take off the golden rings that are on your wives' ears, and the ears of your sons and daughters, and bring them to me."</span>

<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_4" data-id="EX32_4">He received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with an engraving tool and he made a cast idol in the shape of a calf. Then they said, "These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_5" data-id="EX32_5">When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before the calf and made a proclamation; he said, "Tomorrow will be a festival in Yahweh's honor."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_6" data-id="EX32_6">The people arose early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought fellowship offerings. Then they sat down to eat and to drink, and then got up to carouse in wild celebration.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_7" data-id="EX32_7">Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go quickly, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_8" data-id="EX32_8">They have quickly left the way that I commanded them.

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_9" data-id="EX32_9">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "I have seen this people. Look, they are a stiff-necked people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_10" data-id="EX32_10">Now then, do not try to stop me. My anger will burn hot against them, so I will destroy them. Then I will make a great nation from you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_11" data-id="EX32_11">But Moses tried to calm down Yahweh his God. He said, "Yahweh, why does your anger burn against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_12" data-id="EX32_12">Why should the Egyptians say, 'He led them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth?' Turn from your burning anger and relent from this punishment on your people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_13" data-id="EX32_13">Call to mind Abraham and Isaac and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self and said to them, 'I will make your descendants as many as the stars in the heavens, and I will give to your descendants all this land of which I have spoken.

<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_25" data-id="EX32_25">Moses saw that the people were running wild (for Aaron had let them get out of control, causing their enemies to mock them).</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_26" data-id="EX32_26">Then Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is on Yahweh's side, come to me." All the Levites gathered around him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_27" data-id="EX32_27">He said to them, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, says this: 'Let each man fasten his sword on his side and go back and forth from entrance to entrance throughout the camp, and kill his brother, his companion, and his neighbor.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_28" data-id="EX32_28">The Levites did what Moses ordered. That day about three thousand of the people died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_29" data-id="EX32_29">Moses said to the Levites, "You have been placed into Yahweh's service today, for each of you has taken action against his son and his brother, so Yahweh might give you a blessing today."</span>
