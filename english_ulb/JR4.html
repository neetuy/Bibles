<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_23" data-id="JR4_23">I saw the land. Behold! It was formless and empty. For there was no light for the heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_24" data-id="JR4_24">I looked at the mountains. Behold, they were trembling, and all the hills were shaking about.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_26" data-id="JR4_26">I looked. Behold, the orchards were a wilderness and all the cities had been pulled down before Yahweh, before the fury of his wrath."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_27" data-id="JR4_27">This is what Yahweh says, "All the land will become a devastation, but I will not completely destroy it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_28" data-id="JR4_28">For this reason, the land will mourn, and the heavens above will darken. For I have declared my intentions; I will not hold back; I will not turn from carrying them out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_29" data-id="JR4_29">Every city will flee from the noise of the cavalry and the archers with a bow; they will run into the forests.

<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_30" data-id="JR4_30">Now that you have been devastated, what will you do? For though you dress in scarlet, adorn yourself with gold jewelry, and make your eyes look bigger with paint, the men who lusted for you now reject you. Instead, they are trying to take away your life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_31" data-id="JR4_31">So I hear the sound of anguish, distress as in the birth of a firstborn child, the sound of the daughter of Zion. She is gasping for breath. She spreads out her hands, 'Woe to me! I am fainting because of these murderers.'"</span>
