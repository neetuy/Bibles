<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_2" data-id="JS24_2">Joshua said to all the people, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'Your ancestors long ago lived beyond the Euphrates River—Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor—and they worshiped other gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_3" data-id="JS24_3">But I took your father from beyond the Euphrates and led him into the land of Canaan and gave him many descendants through his son Isaac.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_4" data-id="JS24_4">Then to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_5" data-id="JS24_5">I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians with plagues. After that, I brought you out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_6" data-id="JS24_6">I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and you came to the sea. The Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the Sea of Reeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_7" data-id="JS24_7">When your ancestors called out to Yahweh, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians. He brought the sea to come over them and cover them. You saw what I did in Egypt. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_8" data-id="JS24_8">I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand. You took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_9" data-id="JS24_9">Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, got up and attacked Israel. He sent and called for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_10" data-id="JS24_10">But I did not listen to Balaam. Indeed, he blessed you. So I rescued you out of his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_11" data-id="JS24_11">You went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. The leaders of Jericho fought against you, along with the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. I gave you victory over them and put them under your control.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_12" data-id="JS24_12">I sent the hornet before you, which drove them and the two kings of the Amorites out before you. It did not happen by your sword or by your bow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_13" data-id="JS24_13">I gave you land on which you had not worked and cities that you had not built, and now you live in them. You eat the fruit of vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant.'</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_14" data-id="JS24_14">Now fear Yahweh and worship him with all integrity and faithfulness; get rid of the gods that your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and worship Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_15" data-id="JS24_15">If it seems wrong in your eyes for you to worship Yahweh, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live. But as for me and my house, we will worship Yahweh."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_16" data-id="JS24_16">The people answered and said, "We would never forsake Yahweh to serve other gods,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_17" data-id="JS24_17">for it is Yahweh our God who brought us and our ancestors up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight, and who preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the nations through whom we passed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_18" data-id="JS24_18">Then Yahweh drove out before us all the peoples, including the Amorites who lived in the land. So we too will worship Yahweh, for he is our God."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_19" data-id="JS24_19">But Joshua said to the people, "You cannot serve Yahweh, for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions and sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_20" data-id="JS24_20">If you forsake Yahweh and worship foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm. He will consume you, after he has done good to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_21" data-id="JS24_21">But the people said to Joshua, "No, we will worship Yahweh."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_22" data-id="JS24_22">Then Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves Yahweh, to worship him." They said, "We are witnesses."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_23" data-id="JS24_23">"Now put away the foreign gods that are with you, and turn your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_24" data-id="JS24_24">The people said to Joshua, "We will worship Yahweh our God. We will listen to his voice."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_25" data-id="JS24_25">Joshua made a covenant with the people that day. He put in place decrees and laws at Shechem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_26" data-id="JS24_26">Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the law of God. He took a large stone and set it up there beneath the oak tree that was beside Yahweh's sanctuary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_27" data-id="JS24_27">Joshua said to all the people, "Look, this stone will be a testimony against us. It has heard all the words Yahweh said to us. So it will be a witness against you, should you ever deny your God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_28" data-id="JS24_28">So Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.</span>

<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_30" data-id="JS24_30">They buried him within the border of his own inheritance, at Timnath Serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_31" data-id="JS24_31">Israel worshiped Yahweh all of Joshua's days, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, those who had experienced everything that Yahweh had done for Israel.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_32" data-id="JS24_32">The bones of Joseph, which the people of Israel brought up out of Egypt—they buried them at Shechem, in the piece of land that Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem.
