<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_1" data-id="T12_1">Therefore first of all, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_2" data-id="T12_2">for kings and all who are in authority, in order that we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_5" data-id="T12_5">For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.</span>
