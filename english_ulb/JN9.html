<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_1" data-id="JN9_1">Now as Jesus passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_2" data-id="JN9_2">His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, so that he was born blind?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_3" data-id="JN9_3">Jesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents, but so that the works of God would be revealed in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_4" data-id="JN9_4">We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. Night is coming when no one will be able to work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_5" data-id="JN9_5">While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_6" data-id="JN9_6">After Jesus said these things, he spit on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and smeared the mud on his eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_7" data-id="JN9_7">He said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam," (which is translated "Sent"). So the man went away, washed, and came back seeing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_8" data-id="JN9_8">Then the man's neighbors and those who had seen him previously as a beggar were saying, "Is not this the man that used to sit and beg?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_9" data-id="JN9_9">Some said, "It is he." Others said, "No, but he is like him." But he said, "It is me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_10" data-id="JN9_10">They said to him, "Then how were your eyes opened?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_11" data-id="JN9_11">He answered, "The man who is called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went and washed, and I received my sight."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_12" data-id="JN9_12">They said to him, "Where is he?" He replied, "I do not know."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_13" data-id="JN9_13">They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_14" data-id="JN9_14">Now it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_15" data-id="JN9_15">Then again the Pharisees asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I now can see."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_16" data-id="JN9_16">Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" So there was a division among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_17" data-id="JN9_17">So they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?" The blind man said, "He is a prophet."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_18" data-id="JN9_18">Now the Jews still did not believe about him that he was blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of him who had received his sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_19" data-id="JN9_19">They asked the parents, "Is this your son whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_20" data-id="JN9_20">So his parents answered them, "We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_21" data-id="JN9_21">How he now sees, we do not know, and who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him, he is an adult. He can speak for himself."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_22" data-id="JN9_22">His parents said these things, because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that if anyone would confess him to be the Christ, he would be thrown out of the synagogue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_23" data-id="JN9_23">Because of this, his parents said, "He is an adult, ask him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_24" data-id="JN9_24">So for a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_25" data-id="JN9_25">Then that man replied, "I do not know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I see."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_26" data-id="JN9_26">Then they said to him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_27" data-id="JN9_27">He answered, "I have told you already, and you did not listen! Why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become his disciples too, do you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_28" data-id="JN9_28">They insulted him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_29" data-id="JN9_29">We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this one is from."</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_30" data-id="JN9_30">The man answered and said to them, "This is remarkable, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_31" data-id="JN9_31">We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_32" data-id="JN9_32">Since the world began it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_33" data-id="JN9_33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_34" data-id="JN9_34">They answered and said to him, "You were completely born in sins, and you are teaching us?" Then they threw him out.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_35" data-id="JN9_35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out of the synagogue. He found him and said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_36" data-id="JN9_36">He replied and said, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_37" data-id="JN9_37">Jesus said to him, "You have seen him, and it is the one who is speaking with you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_38" data-id="JN9_38">The man said, "Lord, I believe" and he worshiped him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_39" data-id="JN9_39">Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world so that those who do not see may see and so that those who see may become blind."</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_40" data-id="JN9_40">Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and asked him, "Are we also blind?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_41" data-id="JN9_41">Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin, but now you say, 'We see,' so your sin remains."</span>
