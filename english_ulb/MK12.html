<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_1" data-id="MK12_1">Then Jesus began to teach them in parables. He said, "A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, and dug a pit for a winepress. He built a watchtower and then leased the vineyard to vine growers. Then he went away on a journey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_2" data-id="MK12_2">At the right time, he sent a servant to the vine growers to receive from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_3" data-id="MK12_3">But they took him, beat him, and sent him away with nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_4" data-id="MK12_4">Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_5" data-id="MK12_5">He sent yet another, and this one they killed. They treated many others in the same way, beating some and killing others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_6" data-id="MK12_6">He had still one more person to send, a beloved son. He was the last one he sent to them. He said, 'They will respect my son.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_7" data-id="MK12_7">But the vine growers said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_8" data-id="MK12_8">They seized him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_9" data-id="MK12_9">Therefore, what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vine growers and will give the vineyard to others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_10" data-id="MK12_10">Have you not read this scripture?</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_13" data-id="MK12_13">Then they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him to trap him with words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_14" data-id="MK12_14">When they came, they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you care for no one's opinion, and you do not show partiality between people. You truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or not?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_15" data-id="MK12_15">But Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said to them, "Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius so I can look at it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_16" data-id="MK12_16">They brought one to Jesus. He said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" They said, "Caesar's."</span>

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_22" data-id="MK12_22">The seven left no children. Last of all, the woman also died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_23" data-id="MK12_23">In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven brothers had her as their wife."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_24" data-id="MK12_24">Jesus said, "Is this not the reason you are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures nor the power of God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_25" data-id="MK12_25">For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_26" data-id="MK12_26">But concerning the dead that are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account about the bush, how God spoke to him and said, 'I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_27" data-id="MK12_27">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite mistaken."</span>

<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_28" data-id="MK12_28">One of the scribes came and heard their discussion; he saw that Jesus answered them well. He asked him, "What commandment is the most important of all?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_29" data-id="MK12_29">Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_30" data-id="MK12_30">You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_31" data-id="MK12_31">The second commandment is this, 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other greater commandment than these."</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_32" data-id="MK12_32">The scribe said, "Good, Teacher! You have truly said that God is one, and that there is no other besides him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_33" data-id="MK12_33">To love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is even more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_34" data-id="MK12_34">When Jesus saw that he had given a wise answer, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that, no one dared to ask Jesus any more questions.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_35" data-id="MK12_35">While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he said, "How is it that the scribes say the Christ is the son of David?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_36" data-id="MK12_36">David himself, in the Holy Spirit, said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_37" data-id="MK12_37">David himself calls him 'Lord,' so how can the Christ be David's son?" The large crowd gladly listened to him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_38" data-id="MK12_38">In his teaching Jesus said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes and they like the greetings they receive in the marketplaces</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_39" data-id="MK12_39">and they like to have the chief seats in the synagogues and chief places at feasts.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_41" data-id="MK12_41">Then Jesus sat down across from an offering box in the temple area; he was watching people as they dropped their money into the box. Many rich people put in large amounts of money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_42" data-id="MK12_42">Then a poor widow came and put in two mites, worth about a penny.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_43" data-id="MK12_43">He called his disciples and said to them, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them who contributed to the offering box.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_44" data-id="MK12_44">For all of them gave out of their abundance. But this widow, out of her poverty, put in all of the money which she had to live on. "</span>
