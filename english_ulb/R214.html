<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_3" data-id="R214_3">for he took away the foreign altars and the high places. He broke down the stone pillars and cut down the Asherah poles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_4" data-id="R214_4">He commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, and to carry out the law and the commandments.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_6" data-id="R214_6">He built fortified cities in Judah, for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_7" data-id="R214_7">For Asa said to Judah, "Let us build these cities and make walls around them, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is still ours because we have sought Yahweh our God. We have sought him, and he has given us peace on every side." So they built and succeeded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_8" data-id="R214_8">Asa had an army that carried shields and spears; from Judah he had 300,000 men, and from Benjamin, 280,000 men who carried shields and drew bows. All of these were mighty men.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_10" data-id="R214_10">Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle lines in order in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_11" data-id="R214_11">Asa cried to Yahweh, his God, and said, "Yahweh, there is no one but you to help one who has no strength when he is facing many.
