<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_4" data-id="EX12_4">If the household is too small for a lamb, the man and his next door neighbor are to take lamb or young goat meat that will be enough for the number of the people. It should be enough for everyone to eat, so they must take enough meat to feed them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_5" data-id="EX12_5">Your lamb or young goat must be without blemish, a one-year-old male. You may take one of the sheep or goats.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_8" data-id="EX12_8">You must eat the meat that night, after first roasting it over a fire. Eat it with bread made without yeast, along with bitter herbs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_9" data-id="EX12_9">Do not eat it raw or boiled in water. Instead, roast it over fire with its head, legs and inner parts.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_23" data-id="EX12_23">For Yahweh will pass through to attack the Egyptians.
