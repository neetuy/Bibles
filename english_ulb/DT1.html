<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_18" data-id="DT1_18">I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_20" data-id="DT1_20">I said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God is giving to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_21" data-id="DT1_21">Look, Yahweh your God has set the land before you; go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you; do not be afraid, neither be discouraged.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_22" data-id="DT1_22">Every one of you came to me and said, 'Let us send men ahead of us, so that they may search out the land for us, and bring us word about the way by which we should attack, and about the cities to which we will come.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_23" data-id="DT1_23">The advice pleased me well; I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_24" data-id="DT1_24">They turned and went up into the hill country, came to the Valley of Eshkol, and scouted it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_25" data-id="DT1_25">They took some of the produce of the land in their hands and brought it down to us. They also brought us word and said, 'It is a good land that Yahweh our God is giving to us.'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_26" data-id="DT1_26">Yet you refused to attack, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_27" data-id="DT1_27">You complained in your tents and said, "It is because Yahweh hated us that he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_28" data-id="DT1_28">Where can we go now? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, 'Those people are bigger and taller than we are; their cities are large and are fortified up to the heavens; moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_29" data-id="DT1_29">Then I said to you, 'Do not be terrified, neither be afraid of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_30" data-id="DT1_30">Yahweh your God, who goes before you, he will fight for you, like everything that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_31" data-id="DT1_31">and also in the wilderness, where you have seen how Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries his son, everywhere you went until you came to this place.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_32" data-id="DT1_32">Yet in spite of this word you did not believe Yahweh your God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_33" data-id="DT1_33">who went before you on the way to find a place for you to make camp, in fire by night and in a cloud by day.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_34" data-id="DT1_34">Yahweh heard the sound of your words and was angry; he swore and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_35" data-id="DT1_35">'Surely not one of these men of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_36" data-id="DT1_36">save Caleb son of Jephunneh; he will see it. To him I will give the land that he has stepped on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_37" data-id="DT1_37">Also Yahweh was angry with me because of you, saying, 'You also will not go in there;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_38" data-id="DT1_38">Joshua son of Nun, who stands before you, he will go in there; encourage him, for he will lead Israel to inherit it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_39" data-id="DT1_39">Moreover, your little children, the ones you said would be victims, who today have no knowledge of good or evil—they will go in there. To them I will give it, and they will possess it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_40" data-id="DT1_40">But as for you, turn and take your journey into the wilderness along the way to the Sea of Reeds.'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_41" data-id="DT1_41">Then you answered and said to me, 'We have sinned against Yahweh; we will go up and fight, and we will follow all that Yahweh our God has commanded us to do.' Every man among you put on his weapons of war, and you were ready to attack the hill country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_42" data-id="DT1_42">Yahweh said to me, 'Say to them, "Do not attack and do not fight, for I will not be with you, and you will be defeated by your enemies.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_43" data-id="DT1_43">I spoke to you in this way, but you did not listen. You rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh; you were arrogant and attacked the hill country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_44" data-id="DT1_44">But the Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you like bees, and struck you down in Seir, as far as Hormah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_45" data-id="DT1_45">You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh did not listen to your voice, nor did he pay attention to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT1_46" data-id="DT1_46">So you stayed in Kadesh many days, all the days that you stayed there.</span>
