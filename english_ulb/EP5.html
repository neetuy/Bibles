<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_1" data-id="EP5_1">Therefore be imitators of God, as dearly loved children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_2" data-id="EP5_2">And walk in love, as also Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_3" data-id="EP5_3">But there must not be even a suggestion among you of sexual immorality or any kind of impurity or of greed, for these are improper for God's holy people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_4" data-id="EP5_4">Let there be no filthiness, no foolish talk, and no crude jokes—all of which are improper. Instead there should be thanksgiving.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_5" data-id="EP5_5">For you can be sure of this, that no sexually immoral, impure, or greedy person—that is, an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_6" data-id="EP5_6">Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the anger of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_7" data-id="EP5_7">Therefore, do not join in with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_8" data-id="EP5_8">For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_9" data-id="EP5_9">(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth),</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_10" data-id="EP5_10">and find out what is pleasing to the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_11" data-id="EP5_11">Do not associate with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_12" data-id="EP5_12">For it is shameful even to mention the things they do in secret.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_13" data-id="EP5_13">But when anything is illuminated by the light, it becomes visible.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_14" data-id="EP5_14">For anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,</span>

<span class="v EP5_14" data-id="EP5_14">and Christ will shine on you."</div>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_15" data-id="EP5_15">Look carefully how you live—not as unwise but as wise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_16" data-id="EP5_16">Redeem the time because the days are evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_17" data-id="EP5_17">Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_18" data-id="EP5_18">And do not get drunk with wine, for that leads to reckless behavior. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_19" data-id="EP5_19">speaking to each other in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_20" data-id="EP5_20">always giving thanks for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_21" data-id="EP5_21">submitting yourselves to one another in reverence for Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_22" data-id="EP5_22">Wives, submit to your husbands, as to the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_23" data-id="EP5_23">For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ also is the head of the church, and Christ himself is its savior.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_24" data-id="EP5_24">But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives must submit to their husbands in everything.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_25" data-id="EP5_25">Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_26" data-id="EP5_26">Christ gave himself for the church so that he might make her holy, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_27" data-id="EP5_27">so that he might present her to himself as glorious, without stain or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and without fault.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_28" data-id="EP5_28">In the same way husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_29" data-id="EP5_29">For no one ever hated his own body, but nourishes and treats it with care, just as Christ nourishes and treats the church with care,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_30" data-id="EP5_30">because we are members of his body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_31" data-id="EP5_31">"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_32" data-id="EP5_32">This hidden truth is great—but I am speaking about Christ and the church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_33" data-id="EP5_33">Nevertheless, each of you also must love his own wife as himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</span>
