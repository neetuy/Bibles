<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_5" data-id="ZC11_5">(The ones who buy them slaughter them and are not punished, and the ones who sell them say, 'Blessed be Yahweh! I have become rich!' for the shepherds working for the flocks' owners have no pity on them.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_6" data-id="ZC11_6">For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land!—this is Yahweh's declaration. See! I myself am about to turn over every person into the hand of his neighbor and into the hand of his king, and they will destroy the land and none of them will I deliver them from their hand."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_7" data-id="ZC11_7">So I became the shepherd of the flock marked for slaughter, for those who dealt in sheep. I took two staffs; one staff I called "Favor" and the other I called "Unity." In this way I shepherded the flock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_8" data-id="ZC11_8">In one month I destroyed the three shepherds. I became impatient with them, and they also hated me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_9" data-id="ZC11_9">Then I said to the owners, "I will not work as a shepherd for you any longer. The sheep that are dying—let them die; the sheep that are being destroyed—let them be destroyed. Let the sheep that remain each eat the flesh of its neighbor."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_10" data-id="ZC11_10">So I took my staff "Favor" and broke it to break the covenant that I had made with all of my tribes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_11" data-id="ZC11_11">On that day the covenant was broken, and those who dealt in sheep and who were watching me knew that Yahweh had spoken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_12" data-id="ZC11_12">I said to them, "If it seems good to you, pay me my wages. But if not, do not do it." So they weighed out my wages—thirty pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_13" data-id="ZC11_13">Then Yahweh said to me, "Deposit the silver in the treasury, the excellent price at which they valued you!" So I took the thirty pieces of silver and deposited them in the treasury in the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_14" data-id="ZC11_14">Then I broke my second staff, "Unity," to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_15" data-id="ZC11_15">Yahweh said to me, "Again, take the equipment of a foolish shepherd for yourself,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_16" data-id="ZC11_16">for see, I am about to set in place a shepherd in the land. He will not care for the perishing sheep. He will not seek out the sheep gone missing, nor heal the crippled sheep. He will not feed the sheep that are healthy, but will eat the flesh of the fattened sheep and will tear off their hooves.</span>
