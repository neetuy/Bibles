<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX8_22" data-id="EX8_22">But on that day I will treat the land of Goshen differently, the land in which my people are living, so that no swarms of flies will be there. This will happen so that you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of this land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX8_23" data-id="EX8_23">I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This sign of my power will take place tomorrow."'"</span>
