<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_2" data-id="JR27_2">This is what Yahweh said to me, "Make fetters and a yoke for yourself. Place them on your neck.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_3" data-id="JR27_3">Then send them out to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the people of Ammon, the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon. Send them by the hand of those kings' ambassadors who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_4" data-id="JR27_4">Give commands to them for their masters and say, 'Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: This is what you must say to your masters,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_5" data-id="JR27_5">"I myself made the earth by my great strength and my raised arm. I also made the people and animals on the earth, and I give it to anyone who is right in my eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_6" data-id="JR27_6">So now, I myself am giving all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant. Also, I am giving the living things in the fields to him to serve him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_7" data-id="JR27_7">For all the nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until the time for his land comes. Then many nations and great kings will subdue him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_8" data-id="JR27_8">So the nation and the kingdom that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and that does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon—I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with the plague—this is Yahweh's declaration—until I have destroyed it by his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_9" data-id="JR27_9">So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your seers, your soothsayers, and sorcerers, who have been speaking to you and saying, 'Do not serve the king of Babylon.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_10" data-id="JR27_10">For they are prophesying deceit to you in order to send you far away from your lands, for I will drive you away, and you will die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_11" data-id="JR27_11">But the nation that places its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, I will allow it to rest in its land—this is Yahweh's declaration—and they will cultivate it and make their homes in it."'"</span>

<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_12" data-id="JR27_12">So I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah and gave him this message, "Place your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and you will live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_13" data-id="JR27_13">Why will you die—you and your people—by the sword, famine, and plague, just as I have declared about the nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR27_14" data-id="JR27_14">Do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you and say, 'Do not serve the king of Babylon,' for they are prophesying lies to you.</span>
