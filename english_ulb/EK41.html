<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_16" data-id="EK41_16">the inner walls and the windows, including the narrow windows, and the galleries all around on three levels, were all paneled in wood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_17" data-id="EK41_17">Above the entryway to the inner sanctuary and spaced along the walls there was a measured pattern.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_18" data-id="EK41_18">It was decorated with cherubim and palm trees; with a palm tree between each cherub, and each cherub had two faces:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_19" data-id="EK41_19">the face of a man looked toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion looked toward a palm tree on the other side. They were carved all around the entire house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_20" data-id="EK41_20">From the ground to above the doorway, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the outer wall of the house.  </span>
