<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_3" data-id="R216_3">"Let there be a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Look, I have sent to you silver and gold. Break your covenant with Baasha, king of Israel, so that he may leave me alone."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_4" data-id="R216_4">Ben Hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim <span class="note" id="footnote-63"><a href="#note-63" class="key">†</a></span> , and all the storage cities of Naphtali. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_5" data-id="R216_5">It came about that when Baasha heard this, he stopped building up Ramah, and let his work cease.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_6" data-id="R216_6">Then Asa the king took all Judah with him. They carried away the stones and timbers of Ramah with which Baasha had been building up the city. Then King Asa used that building material to build up Geba and Mizpah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_7" data-id="R216_7">At that time Hanani the seer went to Asa, king of Judah, and said to him, "Because you have relied on the king of Aram, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped out of your hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_8" data-id="R216_8">Were not the Cushites and the Libyans a huge army, with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he gave you victory over them.</span>
