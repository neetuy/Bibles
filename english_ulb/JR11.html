<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_1" data-id="JR11_1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_2" data-id="JR11_2">"Listen to the words of this covenant, and declare them to each man in Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_3" data-id="JR11_3">Say to them, 'Yahweh, God of Israel says this: Cursed is anyone who does not listen to the words of this covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_4" data-id="JR11_4">This is the covenant that I commanded your ancestors to keep the day I brought them out from the land of Egypt, from the furnace for smelting iron. I said, "Listen to my voice and do all of these things just as I have commanded you, for you will be my people and I will be your God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_5" data-id="JR11_5">Obey me so that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your ancestors, the oath that I would give them the land flowing with milk and honey, where you live today.'" Then I, Jeremiah, answered and said, "Yes, Yahweh!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_6" data-id="JR11_6">Yahweh said to me, "Proclaim all these things in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. Say, 'Listen to the words of this covenant and carry them out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_7" data-id="JR11_7">For I have been giving solemn commands to your ancestors from the day I brought them up from the land of Egypt until this present time, persistently warning them and saying, "Listen to my voice."'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_8" data-id="JR11_8">But they did not listen or pay attention. Each person has been walking in the stubbornness of his wicked heart. So I brought all the curses in this covenant that I commanded to come against them. But the people still did not obey."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_9" data-id="JR11_9">Next Yahweh said to me, "A conspiracy has been discovered among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_10" data-id="JR11_10">They have turned to the iniquities of their earliest ancestors, who refused to listen to my word, who instead walked after other gods to worship them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah broke my covenant that I established with their ancestors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_11" data-id="JR11_11">Therefore Yahweh says this, 'See, I am about to bring disaster on them, disaster from which they will not be able to escape. Then they will call out to me, but I will not listen to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_12" data-id="JR11_12">The cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and call out to the gods to which they had given offerings, but they will certainly not be saved by them at the time of their disaster.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_13" data-id="JR11_13">For you Judah, the number of your gods has increased to equal the number of your cities. You have made the number of shameful altars in Jerusalem, incense altars for Baal, equal to the number of her streets.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_14" data-id="JR11_14">So you yourself, Jeremiah, must not pray for this people. You must not wail or pray on their behalf. For I will not be listening when they call on me in their disaster.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_15" data-id="JR11_15">Why is my beloved one, the one who has had so many wicked intentions, in my house?</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_16" data-id="JR11_16">In the past Yahweh called you a leafy olive tree, beautiful with lovely fruit.</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JR11_16" data-id="JR11_16">But he will light a fire on it that will sound like the roar of a storm; its branches will be broken.</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_17" data-id="JR11_17">For Yahweh of hosts, the one who planted you, has decreed disaster against you because of the wicked acts that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have committedâ€”they have angered me by giving offerings to Baal.'"</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_18" data-id="JR11_18">Yahweh made me know these things, so I know them. You, Yahweh, made me see their deeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_19" data-id="JR11_19">I was like a gentle lamb being led to a butcher. I did not know that they had formed plans against me, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit! Let us cut him off from the land of the living so his name will be no longer remembered."</span>
