<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_1" data-id="T15_1">Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; younger men as brothers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_2" data-id="T15_2">older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, in all purity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_3" data-id="T15_3">Honor widows, the real widows.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_4" data-id="T15_4">But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show honor in their own household, and to repay their parents, because this is pleasing to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_5" data-id="T15_5">But she who is a real widow, and left all alone, puts her certain hope in God, and always continues in requests and prayers both night and day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_6" data-id="T15_6">However, she who lives for pleasure is dead, even though she is still alive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_7" data-id="T15_7">Command these things also, so that they may be blameless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_8" data-id="T15_8">But if someone does not provide for his own relatives, and especially for his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_9" data-id="T15_9">Only let a widow be enrolled who is not younger than sixty, a wife of one husband,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_10" data-id="T15_10">known for good deeds; if she has cared for children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has been devoted to every good work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_11" data-id="T15_11">But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when they feel bodily desires against Christ, they want to marry,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_12" data-id="T15_12">incurring guilt because they revoke their first commitment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_13" data-id="T15_13">At the same time, they also learn to be lazy, going around from house to house. They not only become lazy, but also speak nonsense and are busybodies, saying things they should not say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_14" data-id="T15_14">I therefore want younger widows to marry, to bear children, to manage their household, and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_15" data-id="T15_15">For some have already turned aside after Satan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_16" data-id="T15_16">If any believing woman has widows, let her help them, so that the church will not be weighed down, so that it might help the real widows.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_17" data-id="T15_17">Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work with the word and in teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_18" data-id="T15_18">For the scripture says, "You shall not put muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain" and "The laborer is worthy of his wages."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_19" data-id="T15_19">Do not receive an accusation against an elder unless there are two or three witnesses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_20" data-id="T15_20">Rebuke those who sin before all so that the rest may also be afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_21" data-id="T15_21">I solemnly command you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, that you should keep these commands without partiality, and do nothing out of favoritism.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_22" data-id="T15_22">Place hands hastily on no one. Do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_23" data-id="T15_23">No longer drink only water, but take a little wine for your stomach and your frequent sicknesses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_24" data-id="T15_24">The sins of some people are openly known, going before them into judgment. But the sins of others follow later.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_25" data-id="T15_25">Likewise, good works are openly known, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.</span>
