<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_2" data-id="EX17_2">So the people blamed Moses for their situation and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses said, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_3" data-id="EX17_3">The people were very thirsty, and they complained against Moses. They said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt? To kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_4" data-id="EX17_4">Then Moses cried out to Yahweh, "What should I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_5" data-id="EX17_5">Yahweh said to Moses, "Go on ahead of the people, and take with you some elders of Israel. Take with you the staff with which you struck the river, and go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_6" data-id="EX17_6">I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you will strike the rock. Water will come out of it for the people to drink." Then Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_7" data-id="EX17_7">He called that place Massah and Meribah because of the Israelites' complaining, and because they had tested the Lord by saying, "Is Yahweh among us or not?"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_8" data-id="EX17_8">Then an army of the Amalek people came and attacked Israel at Rephidim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_9" data-id="EX17_9">So Moses said to Joshua, "Choose some men and go out. Fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_10" data-id="EX17_10">So Joshua fought Amalek as Moses had instructed, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_11" data-id="EX17_11">While Moses was holding his hands up, Israel was winning; when he let his hands rest, Amalek would begin to win.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_12" data-id="EX17_12">When Moses' hands became heavy, Aaron and Hur took a stone and put it under him for him to sit on. At the same time, Aaron and Hur held his hands up, one person on one side of him, and the other person on the other side. So Moses' hands were held steady until the sun went down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_13" data-id="EX17_13">So Joshua defeated the people of Amalek with the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_14" data-id="EX17_14">Yahweh said to Moses, "Write this in a book and read it in Joshua's hearing, because I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under the skies."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_15" data-id="EX17_15">Then Moses built an altar and he called it "Yahweh is my banner."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX17_16" data-id="EX17_16">He said, "For a hand was lifted up to the throne of Yahwehâ€”that Yahweh will wage war with Amalek from generation to generation."</span>
