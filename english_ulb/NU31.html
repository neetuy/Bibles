<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_2" data-id="NU31_2">"Take vengeance on the Midianites for what they did to the Israelites. After doing that, you will die and be gathered to your people."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_3" data-id="NU31_3">So Moses spoke to the people. He said, "Arm some of your men for war so they may go against Midian and carry out Yahweh's vengeance on it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_4" data-id="NU31_4">Every tribe throughout Israel must send a thousand soldiers to war."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_5" data-id="NU31_5">So out of Israel's thousands of men, one thousand was provided from each tribe, twelve thousand men armed for war.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_6" data-id="NU31_6">Then Moses sent them to battle, a thousand from every tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, and with some articles from the holy place and the trumpets in his possession for sounding signals.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_7" data-id="NU31_7">They fought against Midian, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. They killed every man.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_9" data-id="NU31_9">The army of Israel took captive the women of Midian, their children, all their cattle, all their flocks, and all their goods. They took these as plunder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_10" data-id="NU31_10">They burned all their cities where they lived and all their camps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_11" data-id="NU31_11">They took all the plunder and prisoners, both people and animals.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_12" data-id="NU31_12">They brought the prisoners, the plunder, and the captured things to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the community of the people of Israel.

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_20" data-id="NU31_20">You must purify every garment and everything made of animal hide and goats' hair, and everything made of wood."</span>

<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_24" data-id="NU31_24">You must wash your clothes on the seventh day, and then you will become clean. Afterward you may come into Israel's camp."</span>

<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_27" data-id="NU31_27">must divide the plunder into two parts. Divide it between the soldiers who went out to battle and all the rest of the community.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_28" data-id="NU31_28">Then levy a tax to be given to me from the soldiers who went out to battle. This tax must be one out of every five hundred, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, or goats.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_29" data-id="NU31_29">Take this tax from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest for an offering to be presented to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_30" data-id="NU31_30">Also from the people of Israel's half, you must take one out of every fifty—from the persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats. Give these to the Levites who take care of my tabernacle."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_31" data-id="NU31_31">So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh had commanded Moses.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_48" data-id="NU31_48">Then the officers of the army, the commanders over thousands and the captains over hundreds, came to Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_49" data-id="NU31_49">They said to him, "Your servants have counted the soldiers who are under our command, and not one man is missing.</span>
