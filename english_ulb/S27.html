<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_2" data-id="S27_2">the king said to Nathan the prophet, "Look, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is staying in the middle of a tent."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_3" data-id="S27_3">Then Nathan said to the king, "Go, do what is in your heart, for Yahweh is with you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_4" data-id="S27_4">But that same night the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_5" data-id="S27_5">"Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what Yahweh says: Will you build me a house in which to live?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_6" data-id="S27_6">For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up the people of Israel out of Egypt until this present day; instead, I have been moving about in a tent, a tabernacle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_7" data-id="S27_7">In all places where I have moved among all the people of Israel, did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people Israel, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'"</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_11" data-id="S27_11">as they were doing from the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel.

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_18" data-id="S27_18">Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh and said, "Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family that you have brought me to this point?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_19" data-id="S27_19">Now this was a small thing in your sight, Lord Yahweh. You have even spoken about your servant's family for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, Lord Yahweh!</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_20" data-id="S27_20">What more can I, David, say to you? You have known your servant, Lord Yahweh.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_22" data-id="S27_22">Therefore you are great, Lord Yahweh, for there is no one like you, and there is no God besides you, as we have heard with our own ears.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_23" data-id="S27_23">What nation is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom you, God, went and rescued for yourself? You did this so that they would become a people for yourself, to make a name for yourself, and to do great and fearful deeds for your land. You drove out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you rescued from Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_24" data-id="S27_24">You established Israel as your own people forever, and you, Yahweh, became their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_25" data-id="S27_25">So now, Yahweh God, may the promise that you made concerning your servant and his family be established forever. Do as you have spoken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_26" data-id="S27_26">May your name be forever great, so the people will say, 'Yahweh of hosts is the God of Israel,' while the house of me, David, your servant is established before you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_27" data-id="S27_27">For you, Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. That is why I, your servant, have found courage to pray to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_28" data-id="S27_28">Now, Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are trustworthy, and you have made this good promise to your servant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_29" data-id="S27_29">Now then, let it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you.
