<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_3" data-id="LV6_3">or he has found something that his neighbor lost and lies about it, or if he swears falsely, or in any matters like these by which people sin,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_4" data-id="LV6_4">and if he has sinned and is found to be guilty, he must restore whatever he took by robbery or oppression, or that which was entrusted to him, or that which was lost but that he had found.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_5" data-id="LV6_5">In addition, in any matter in which he swore falsely, he must restore it in full and he must add one-fifth of the value of it and pay it all to the owner on the day that he is found guilty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_6" data-id="LV6_6">Then he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish from the flock that is worth the current value, as a guilt offering to the priest.</span>
