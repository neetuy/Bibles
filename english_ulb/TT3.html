<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_1" data-id="TT3_1">Remind them to submit to rulers and authorities, to obey them, to be ready for every good work,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_2" data-id="TT3_2">to revile no one, to not be eager to fight, and to be gentle, showing all humility toward everyone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_3" data-id="TT3_3">For once we ourselves were thoughtless and disobedient. We were led astray and enslaved by various passions and pleasures. We lived in evil and envy. We were detestable and hated one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_4" data-id="TT3_4">But when the kindness of God our savior and his love for mankind appeared,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_5" data-id="TT3_5">it was not by works of righteousness that we did, but by his mercy that he saved us, through the washing of new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_6" data-id="TT3_6">whom God richly poured on us through our Savior Jesus Christ,</span>

<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_8" data-id="TT3_8">This message is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to engage themselves in good works. These things are good and useful for everyone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_9" data-id="TT3_9">But avoid foolish debates and genealogies and strife and conflict about the law. Those things are unprofitable and worthless.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_11" data-id="TT3_11">knowing that such a person has turned from the right way and is sinning and condemns himself.</span>
