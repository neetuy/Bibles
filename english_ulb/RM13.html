<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_1" data-id="RM13_1">Let every soul be obedient to higher authorities, for there is no authority unless it comes from God. The authorities that exist have been appointed by God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_2" data-id="RM13_2">Therefore he who resists that authority opposes the command of God; and those who oppose it will receive judgment on themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_3" data-id="RM13_3">For rulers are not a terror to good deeds, but to evil deeds. Do you desire to be unafraid of the one in authority? Do what is good, and you will receive his approval.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_4" data-id="RM13_4">For he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for he does not carry the sword for no reason. For he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath on the one who does evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_5" data-id="RM13_5">Therefore you must obey, not only because of the wrath, but also because of conscience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_6" data-id="RM13_6">Because of this you pay taxes also. For authorities are servants of God, who attend to this very thing continually.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_7" data-id="RM13_7">Pay to everyone what is owed to them. Tax to whom tax is due, toll to whom toll is due; fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_8" data-id="RM13_8">Owe no one anything, except to love one another. For he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_9" data-id="RM13_9">The commandments: "Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not covet," and if there is any other commandment also, it is summed up in this sentence: "Love your neighbor as yourself."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_10" data-id="RM13_10">Love does not harm one's neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_11" data-id="RM13_11">Because of this, you know the time, that it is already time for you to awake out of sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_12" data-id="RM13_12">The night has advanced, and the day has come near. Let us therefore put aside the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_13" data-id="RM13_13">Let us walk appropriately, as in the day, not in drunken celebrations or drunkenness; and let us not walk in sexual immorality or in uncontrolled lust, and not in strife or jealousy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_14" data-id="RM13_14">But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its lusts.</span>
