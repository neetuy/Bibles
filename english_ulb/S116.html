<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S116_12" data-id="S116_12">Jesse sent and brought him in. Now this son was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. Yahweh said, "Arise, anoint him; for he is the one."</span>

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S116_18" data-id="S116_18">Then one of the young men answered, and said, "I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a strong, courageous man, a man of war, one prudent in speech, a handsome man; and Yahweh is with him."</span>
