<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_1" data-id="HB2_1">Therefore we must give far more attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_2" data-id="HB2_2">For if the message that was spoken through the angels proved to be so reliable, and every trespass and disobedience receives just punishment,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_3" data-id="HB2_3">how then can we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This is salvation that was first announced by the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_4" data-id="HB2_4">At the same time God testified to it by signs, wonders, and various powerful deeds, and by distributing the gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his will.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_5" data-id="HB2_5">For it was not to the angels that God subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_6" data-id="HB2_6">Instead, someone has somewhere testified, saying,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_6" data-id="HB2_6">"What is man, that you are mindful of him?</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_6" data-id="HB2_6">Or a son of man, that you care for him?</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_7" data-id="HB2_7">You made man a little lower than the angels;</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_7" data-id="HB2_7">you crowned him with glory and honor. <span class="note" id="footnote-315"><a href="#note-315" class="key">†</a></span></div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_8" data-id="HB2_8">You put everything in subjection under his feet."</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v HB2_8" data-id="HB2_8">For it was to him that God has subjected all things. He did not leave anything not subjected to him. But now we do not yet see everything subjected to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_9" data-id="HB2_9">But we see him who was made lower than the angels for a little while, Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of his suffering and death, so that by God's grace he might taste death for everyone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_10" data-id="HB2_10">For it was proper for God, because everything exists for him and through him, to bring many sons to glory. It was proper for him to make the leader of their salvation complete through his sufferings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_11" data-id="HB2_11">For both the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified have one source. So he is not ashamed to call them brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_12" data-id="HB2_12">He says,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_12" data-id="HB2_12">"I will proclaim your name to my brothers,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_12" data-id="HB2_12">I will sing about you from inside the assembly."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_13" data-id="HB2_13">And again,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_13" data-id="HB2_13">"I will trust in him."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v HB2_13" data-id="HB2_13">And again,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_13" data-id="HB2_13">"See, here am I and the children whom God has given me."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_14" data-id="HB2_14">Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he likewise shared in the same, so that through death he might abolish the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_15" data-id="HB2_15">This was so that he would free all those who through fear of death lived all their lives in slavery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_16" data-id="HB2_16">For of course it is not with angels that he is concerned; instead, it is with the seed of Abraham that he is concerned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_17" data-id="HB2_17">So it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in all ways, so that he would be a merciful and faithful high priest in relation to the things of God, and so that he would bring about the pardon of the people's sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_18" data-id="HB2_18">Because Jesus himself has suffered and was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</span>
