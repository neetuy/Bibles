She broke the jar and poured it on his head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_4" data-id="MK14_4">But there were some who were angry. They spoke among themselves and said, "What is the reason for this waste?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_5" data-id="MK14_5">This perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor." Then they scolded her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_6" data-id="MK14_6">But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why are you troubling her? She has done a beautiful thing for me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_22" data-id="MK14_22">As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, and broke it. He gave it to them and said, "Take this. This is my body."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_23" data-id="MK14_23">He took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_31" data-id="MK14_31">But Peter said, "If I must die with you, I will not deny you." They all made the same promise.</span>

<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_47" data-id="MK14_47">But one of them who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_48" data-id="MK14_48">Jesus said to them, "Do you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?</span>

<span class="v-num v-55 " data-id="bibleJsn">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_55" data-id="MK14_55">Now the chief priests and the entire Jewish council were seeking testimony against Jesus so they might put him to death. But they did not find any.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56 " data-id="bibleJsn">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_56" data-id="MK14_56">For many brought false testimony against him, but even their testimony did not agree.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57 " data-id="bibleJsn">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_57" data-id="MK14_57">Some stood up and brought false testimony against him; they said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-60 " data-id="bibleJsn">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_60" data-id="MK14_60">The high priest stood up among them and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What is it these men testify against you?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-61 " data-id="bibleJsn">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_61" data-id="MK14_61">But he was silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned him and said, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-62 " data-id="bibleJsn">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_62" data-id="MK14_62">Jesus said, "I am;</span>

<span class="v-num v-65 " data-id="bibleJsn">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_65" data-id="MK14_65">Some began to spit on him and to cover his face and strike him and say to him, "Prophesy!" The officers took him and beat him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-66 " data-id="bibleJsn">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_66" data-id="MK14_66">While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-67 " data-id="bibleJsn">67&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_67" data-id="MK14_67">She saw Peter warming himself, and she looked closely at him and said, "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus."</span>
<span class="v-num v-68 " data-id="bibleJsn">68&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_68" data-id="MK14_68">But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are talking about."

<span class="v-num v-69 " data-id="bibleJsn">69&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_69" data-id="MK14_69">But the servant girl there saw him and began to say again to those who stood there, "This man is one of them!"</span>

<span class="v-num v-71 " data-id="bibleJsn">71&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_71" data-id="MK14_71">But he began to put himself under curses and to swear, "I do not know this man you are talking about."</span>
