<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_2" data-id="JR13_2">So I bought an undergarment as Yahweh directed, and I put in on around my waist.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_3" data-id="JR13_3">Then the word of Yahweh came to me a second time, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_4" data-id="JR13_4">"Take the undergarment that you purchased that is around your waist, get up and go now to Perath. <span class="note" id="footnote-168"><a href="#note-168" class="key">†</a></span> Hide it there in a rock crevice."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_5" data-id="JR13_5">So I went and hid it in Perath, just as Yahweh had commanded me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_6" data-id="JR13_6">After many days, Yahweh said to me, "Get up and go back to Perath. Take from there the undergarment that I had told you to hide."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_7" data-id="JR13_7">So I went back to Perath <span class="note" id="footnote-169"><a href="#note-169" class="key">†</a></span> and dug out the undergarment where I had hid it, and behold, it was destroyed and completely useless.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_10" data-id="JR13_10">This wicked people who refuses to listen to my word, who walk in the hardness of their heart, who go after other gods to worship them and bow down to them—they will be like this undergarment that is good for nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_11" data-id="JR13_11">For just as an undergarment clings to someone's hips, so I have made all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah cling to me—this is Yahweh's declaration—to be my people, to bring me fame, praise, and honor. But they would not listen to me.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_12" data-id="JR13_12">So you must speak this word to them, 'Yahweh, the God of Israel, says this: Every jar will be filled with wine.' They will say to you, 'Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_13" data-id="JR13_13">So say to them, 'Yahweh says this: See, I am about to fill with drunkenness every inhabitant of this land, the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_14" data-id="JR13_14">Then I will smash each man against the other, fathers and children together—this is Yahweh's declaration—I will not pity them or have compassion, and I will not spare them from destruction.'"</span>
