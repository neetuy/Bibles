<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_2" data-id="NU14_2">All the people of Israel criticized Moses and Aaron. The whole community said to them, "We wish we had died in the land of Egypt, or here in this wilderness!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_3" data-id="NU14_3">Why did Yahweh bring us to this land to die by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become victims. Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_4" data-id="NU14_4">They said to each another, "Let us choose another leader, and let us return to Egypt."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_5" data-id="NU14_5">Then Moses and Aaron lay facedown before all the assembly of the community of the people of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_7" data-id="NU14_7">They spoke to all the community of the people of Israel. They said, "The land that we passed through and examined is a very good land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_8" data-id="NU14_8">If Yahweh is pleased with us, then he will take us into this land and give it to us. The land flows with milk and honey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_9" data-id="NU14_9">But do not rebel against Yahweh, and do not fear the people in the land, for they are bread to us. Their protection will be removed from them, because Yahweh is with us. Do not fear them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_10" data-id="NU14_10">Then all the congregation said to stone them with stones. But the glory of Yahweh appeared at the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_13" data-id="NU14_13">Moses said to Yahweh, "If you do this, then the Egyptians will hear about it, because you rescued this people from them by your power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_14" data-id="NU14_14">They will tell it to this land's inhabitants. They have heard that you, Yahweh, are present with this people, because you are seen face to face. Your cloud stands over our people. You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_15" data-id="NU14_15">Now if you kill this people as one man, then the nations that have heard of your fame will speak and say,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_16" data-id="NU14_16">'Because Yahweh could not take this people into the land that he swore to give them, he has killed them in the wilderness.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_23" data-id="NU14_23">So I say that they will certainly not see the land about which I made an oath to their ancestors. Not one of them who despised me will see it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_24" data-id="NU14_24">except for my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit. He has followed me fully; I will bring him into the land which he went to examine. His descendants will possess it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_26" data-id="NU14_26">Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron. He said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_30" data-id="NU14_30">You will certainly not go into the land that I promised to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_31" data-id="NU14_31">But your little ones who you said would be victims, I will take them into the land. They will experience the land that you have rejected!</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_32" data-id="NU14_32">As for you, your dead bodies will fall in this wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_33" data-id="NU14_33">Your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years. They must bear the consequences of your acts of rebellion until the end of your corpses in the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_34" data-id="NU14_34">Just as the number of the days during which you examined the land—forty days, you must likewise bear the consequences of your sins for forty years—one year for every day, and you must know what it is like for me to oppose you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_35" data-id="NU14_35">I, Yahweh, have spoken. I will certainly do this to all this evil community that is gathered together against me. They will be completely cut off, and here they will die.'"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_36" data-id="NU14_36">So the men Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made the entire community grumble against Moses by spreading a bad report about the land—</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_37" data-id="NU14_37">these men who had brought out a bad report about the land were struck down, and they died of a plague before Yahweh.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_39" data-id="NU14_39">When Moses reported these words to all the people of Israel, they mourned very deeply.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_40" data-id="NU14_40">They rose up early in the morning and went to the top of the mountain and said, "Look, we are here, and we will go to the place that Yahweh has promised, for we have sinned."</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU14_41" data-id="NU14_41">But Moses said, "Why are you now violating Yahweh's command? You will not succeed.</span>
