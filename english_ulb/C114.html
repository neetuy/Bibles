<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_1" data-id="C114_1">Pursue love and be zealous for spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_2" data-id="C114_2">For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. For no one understands him because he speaks hidden things in the Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_3" data-id="C114_3">But the one who prophesies speaks to people to build them up, to encourage them, and to comfort them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_4" data-id="C114_4">The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_5" data-id="C114_5">Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues. But even more than that, I wish that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues (unless someone interprets so that the church may be built up).</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_6" data-id="C114_6">But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you? I cannot, unless I speak to you with revelation, or knowledge, or prophecy, or teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_7" data-id="C114_7">If lifeless instruments are producing sounds—like the flute or the harp—and they do not produce different tones, how will anyone know what tune the flute or harp is playing?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_8" data-id="C114_8">For if the trumpet is played with an uncertain sound, how will anyone know when it is time to prepare for battle?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_9" data-id="C114_9">So it is with you. If you utter speech that is unintelligible, how will anyone understand what you have said? You will be speaking, and no one will understand you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_10" data-id="C114_10">There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_11" data-id="C114_11">But if I do not know the meaning of a language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_12" data-id="C114_12">So it is with you. Since you are eager for the manifestations of the Spirit, try to excel in the gifts that build up the church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_13" data-id="C114_13">So the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_14" data-id="C114_14">For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_15" data-id="C114_15">What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, and I will also sing with my mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_16" data-id="C114_16">Otherwise, if you praise God with the spirit, how will the outsider say "Amen" when you are giving thanks if he does not know what you are saying?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_17" data-id="C114_17">For you certainly give thanks well enough, but the other person is not built up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_18" data-id="C114_18">I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_19" data-id="C114_19">But in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding so that I might instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_20" data-id="C114_20">Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Rather, in regard to evil, be like infants. But in your thinking be mature.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_21" data-id="C114_21">In the law it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C114_21" data-id="C114_21">"By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v C114_21" data-id="C114_21">I will speak to this people.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C114_21" data-id="C114_21">Even then they will not hear me,"</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v C114_21" data-id="C114_21">says the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_22" data-id="C114_22">So then, tongues are a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers. But prophesying is for a sign, not for unbelievers, but for believers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_23" data-id="C114_23">If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders and unbelievers come in, would they not say that you are insane?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_24" data-id="C114_24">But if you all were prophesying and an unbeliever or an outsider came in, he would be convicted by all he hears. He would be judged by all that is said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_25" data-id="C114_25">The secrets of his heart would be revealed. As a result, he would fall on his face and worship God. He would declare that God is really among you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_26" data-id="C114_26">What is next then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Do everything so that you build up the church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_27" data-id="C114_27">If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at most three, and each one in turn, then someone should interpret what is said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_28" data-id="C114_28">But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in the church. Let each one speak to himself alone and to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_29" data-id="C114_29">Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others listen with discernment to what is said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_30" data-id="C114_30">But if an insight is given to one who is sitting in the service, let the one who had been speaking be silent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_31" data-id="C114_31">For each of you can prophesy one by one so that each one may learn and all may be encouraged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_32" data-id="C114_32">For the spirits of the prophets are under the control of the prophets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_33" data-id="C114_33">For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v C114_33" data-id="C114_33">This is the rule in all the churches of the saints.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_34" data-id="C114_34">The women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak. Instead, they should be in submission, as also the law says.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_35" data-id="C114_35">If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_36" data-id="C114_36">Did the word of God come from you? Are you the only ones it has reached?</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_37" data-id="C114_37">If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I write to you are a command of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_38" data-id="C114_38">But if anyone does not recognize this, let him not be recognized. <span class="note" id="footnote-291"><a href="#note-291" class="key">†</a></span></span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_39" data-id="C114_39">So then, brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid anyone from speaking in tongues.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_40" data-id="C114_40">But let all things be done properly and in order.</span>
