<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_11" data-id="RV1_11">It said, "Write what you see in a book, and send it to the seven churches—to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_12" data-id="RV1_12">I turned around to see whose voice was speaking to me, and as I turned I saw seven golden lampstands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_13" data-id="RV1_13">In the middle of the lampstands there was one like a son of man, wearing a long robe that reached down to his feet and a golden sash around his chest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_14" data-id="RV1_14">His head and hair were as white as wool—as white as snow—and his eyes were like a flame of fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_15" data-id="RV1_15">His feet were like polished bronze, like bronze that had been refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many rushing waters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_16" data-id="RV1_16">He had seven stars in his right hand, and a sword with two sharp edges was coming out of his mouth. His face was shining like the sun at its strongest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_17" data-id="RV1_17">When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He placed his right hand on me and said, "Do not be afraid. I am the first and the last,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_18" data-id="RV1_18">and the one who lives. I was dead, but look, I live forever! And I have the keys of death and of Hades.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_19" data-id="RV1_19">Therefore write down what you have seen, what is now, and what will take place after this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_20" data-id="RV1_20">As for the hidden meaning about the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."</span>
