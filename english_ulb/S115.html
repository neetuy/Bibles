<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_1" data-id="S115_1">Samuel said to Saul, "Yahweh sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel. Now listen to the words of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_2" data-id="S115_2">This is what Yahweh of hosts says, 'I have noted what Amalek did to Israel in opposing them on the way, when they came up from Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_3" data-id="S115_3">Now go and attack Amalek and completely destroy all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_4" data-id="S115_4">Saul summoned the people and numbered them at the city of Telaim—two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_5" data-id="S115_5">Then Saul came to the city of Amalek and waited in the valley.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_6" data-id="S115_6">Then Saul said to the Kenites, "Go, depart, come out from among the Amalekites, so I do not destroy you along with them. For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel, when they came from Egypt." So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_7" data-id="S115_7">Then Saul attacked the Amalekites, from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_8" data-id="S115_8">Then he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive; he completely destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_9" data-id="S115_9">But Saul and the people spared Agag, as well as the best of the sheep, oxen, fattened calves, and the lambs. Everything that was good, they did not destroy. But they completely destroyed anything that was despised and worthless.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_10" data-id="S115_10">Then the word of Yahweh came to Samuel, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_11" data-id="S115_11">"It grieves me that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments." Samuel was angry; he cried out to Yahweh all night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_12" data-id="S115_12">Samuel got up early to meet Saul in the morning. Samuel was told, "Saul came to Carmel and he set up a monument to himself, then turned and proceeded on down to Gilgal."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_13" data-id="S115_13">Then Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, "Blessed are you by Yahweh! I have fulfilled the command of Yahweh."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_14" data-id="S115_14">Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_15" data-id="S115_15">Saul replied, "They have brought them from the Amalekites. For the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. The rest we have completely destroyed."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_16" data-id="S115_16">Then Samuel said to Saul, "Wait, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me tonight." Saul said to him, "Speak!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_17" data-id="S115_17">Samuel said, "Though you are little in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel? Then Yahweh anointed you king over Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_18" data-id="S115_18">and Yahweh sent you on your way and said, 'Go and completely destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are destroyed.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_19" data-id="S115_19">Why did you not obey the voice of Yahweh, but instead you seized the booty and did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_20" data-id="S115_20">Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have indeed obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone on the way that Yahweh sent me. I have captured Agag, the king of Amalek, and have completely destroyed the Amalekites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_21" data-id="S115_21">But the people took some of the booty—sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_22" data-id="S115_22">Samuel replied, "Has Yahweh as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Obedience is better than sacrifice, and to listen is better than the fat of rams.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_23" data-id="S115_23">For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and stubbornness is like wickedness and iniquity. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_24" data-id="S115_24">Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned; for I have broken Yahweh's commandment and your words, because I was afraid of the people and obeyed their voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_25" data-id="S115_25">Now, please pardon my sin, and return with me so that I may worship Yahweh."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_26" data-id="S115_26">Samuel said to Saul, "I will not go back with you; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_27" data-id="S115_27">As Samuel turned to leave, Saul took hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_28" data-id="S115_28">Samuel said to him, "Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to a neighbor of yours, one who is better than you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_29" data-id="S115_29">Also, the Strength of Israel will not lie nor change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind."</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_30" data-id="S115_30">Then Saul said, "I have sinned. But please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel. Turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_31" data-id="S115_31">So Samuel turned again after Saul, and Saul worshiped Yahweh.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_32" data-id="S115_32">Then Samuel said, "Bring Agag the king of the Amalekites here to me." Agag came to him confined with chains and said, "Surely the bitterness of death has past."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_33" data-id="S115_33">Samuel replied, "As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women." Then Samuel chopped Agag to pieces before Yahweh at Gilgal.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_34" data-id="S115_34">Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v S115_35" data-id="S115_35">Samuel did not see Saul until the day of his death, for he mourned for Saul. Yahweh was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span>
