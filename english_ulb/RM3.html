<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_1" data-id="RM3_1">Then what advantage does the Jew have? And what is the benefit of circumcision?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_2" data-id="RM3_2">It is great in every way. First of all, the Jews were entrusted with revelation from God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_3" data-id="RM3_3">For what if some Jews were without faith? Will their unbelief abolish God's faithfulness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_4" data-id="RM3_4">May it never be. Instead, let God be found to be true, even though every man is a liar. As it has been written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM3_4" data-id="RM3_4">"That you might be shown to be righteous in your words,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM3_4" data-id="RM3_4">and that you might prevail when you come into judgment."</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_5" data-id="RM3_5">But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what can we say? Can we say that God is unrighteous to bring his wrath upon us? (I am using a human argument.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_6" data-id="RM3_6">May it never be! For then how would God judge the world?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_7" data-id="RM3_7">But if the truth of God through my lie provides abundant praise for him, why am I still being judged as a sinner?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_8" data-id="RM3_8">Why not say, as we are falsely reported to say, and as some affirm that we say, "Let us do evil, so that good may come"? The judgment on them is just.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_9" data-id="RM3_9">What then? Are we excusing ourselves? Not at all. For we have already accused both Jews and Greeks, all of them, of being under sin.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_19" data-id="RM3_19">Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to the ones who are under the law. This is in order that every mouth may be shut, and the whole world held accountable to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_20" data-id="RM3_20">This is because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_21" data-id="RM3_21">But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known. It was witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_22" data-id="RM3_22">that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe. For there is no distinction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_23" data-id="RM3_23">For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_24" data-id="RM3_24">and they are freely justified by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_25" data-id="RM3_25">For God provided Christ Jesus as a propitiation through faith in his blood. He offered Christ as proof of his justice, because of his disregard of previous sins</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_26" data-id="RM3_26">in his patience. This all happened for the demonstration of his righteousness at this present time. This was so he could prove himself just, and to show that he justifies anyone because of faith in Jesus.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_27" data-id="RM3_27">Where then is boasting? It is excluded. On what grounds? Of works? No, but on the grounds of faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_28" data-id="RM3_28">We conclude then that a person is justified by faith without works of the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_29" data-id="RM3_29">Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not also the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_30" data-id="RM3_30">If, indeed, God is one, he will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_31" data-id="RM3_31">Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! Instead, we uphold the law.</span>
