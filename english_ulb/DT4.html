<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_2" data-id="DT4_2">You will not add to the words that I command you, neither will you diminish them, so that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God that I am about to command you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_3" data-id="DT4_3">Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for all the men who followed the Baal of Peor, Yahweh your God has destroyed them from among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_4" data-id="DT4_4">But you who clung to Yahweh your God are alive today, every one of you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_10" data-id="DT4_10">On the day that you stood before Yahweh your God at Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, 'Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_26" data-id="DT4_26">I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that you will soon utterly perish from off the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess; you will not prolong your days in it, but you will be completely destroyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_27" data-id="DT4_27">Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh will lead you away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_28" data-id="DT4_28">There you will serve other gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, hear, eat, nor smell.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_29" data-id="DT4_29">But from there you will seek Yahweh your God, and you will find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_30" data-id="DT4_30">When you are in distress, and when all these things will have come on you, in those later days you will return to Yahweh your God and listen to his voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_31" data-id="DT4_31">For Yahweh your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers that he swore to them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_37" data-id="DT4_37">Because he loved your fathers, he chose their descendants after them, and brought you out of Egypt with his presence, with his great power;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT4_38" data-id="DT4_38">in order to drive out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land as an inheritance, as today.</span>
