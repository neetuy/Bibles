<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG12_6" data-id="JG12_6">then they would say to him, "Say: Shibboleth," and if he said "Sibboleth" (for he could not pronounce the word correctly), the Gileadites would seize him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time.</span>
