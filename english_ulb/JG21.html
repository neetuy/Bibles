<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_6" data-id="JG21_6">The people of Israel had compassion for their brother Benjamin. They said, "Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_16" data-id="JG21_16">Then the leaders of the assembly said, "How will we arrange wives for the Benjamites who are left, since the women of Benjamin have been killed?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_17" data-id="JG21_17">They said, "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe is not destroyed from Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_18" data-id="JG21_18">We cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the people of Israel had made a promise, 'Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to Benjamin.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_19" data-id="JG21_19">So they said, "You know there is a feast for Yahweh every year at Shiloh (which is north of Bethel, east of the road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah)."</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_20" data-id="JG21_20">They instructed the men of Benjamin, saying, "Go and hide in secret and wait in the vineyards.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_21" data-id="JG21_21">Watch for the time when the girls from Shiloh come out to dance, then rush out of the vineyards and each one of you should grab a wife from the girls of Shiloh, then go back to the land of Benjamin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_22" data-id="JG21_22">When their fathers or their brothers come to protest to us, we will say to them, 'Show us favor!
