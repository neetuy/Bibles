<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK14_2" data-id="EK14_2">Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK14_3" data-id="EK14_3">"Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts and have put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their own faces. Should I be inquired of at all by them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK14_4" data-id="EK14_4">Therefore announce this to them and say to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, or who puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and who then comes to a prophet—I, Yahweh, will answer him according to the number of his idols.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK14_5" data-id="EK14_5">I will do this so that I may take back the house of Israel in their hearts that have been driven far from me through their idols.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK14_6" data-id="EK14_6">Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Repent and turn away from your idols! Turn back your faces from all your abominations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK14_7" data-id="EK14_7">For every one from the house of Israel and every one of the foreigners staying in Israel who deserts me, who takes his idols into his heart and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his own face, and who then comes to a prophet to seek me—I, Yahweh, will answer him myself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK14_8" data-id="EK14_8">So I will set my face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, for I will cut him off from the midst of my people, and you will know that I am Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK14_9" data-id="EK14_9">If a prophet is deceived and speaks a message, then I, Yahweh, will deceive that prophet; I will reach out with my hand against him and destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK14_10" data-id="EK14_10">They will carry their own iniquity; the iniquity of the prophet will be the same as the iniquity of the one who inquires from him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK14_23" data-id="EK14_23">The survivors will comfort you when you see their ways and their actions, so you will know all these things I have done against her, that I have not done them in vain!—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."</span>
