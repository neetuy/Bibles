<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_1" data-id="GN40_1">It came about that after these things, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and king's baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_2" data-id="GN40_2">Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief of the cupbearers and the chief of the bakers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_3" data-id="GN40_3">He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_4" data-id="GN40_4">The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to them, and he served them. They remained in custody for some time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_5" data-id="GN40_5">Both of them dreamed a dream—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt who were confined in the prison—each man had his own dream in the same night, and each dream had its own interpretation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_6" data-id="GN40_6">Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them. Behold, they were sad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_7" data-id="GN40_7">He asked Pharaoh's officials who were with him in custody in his master's house, saying, "Why do you look so sad today?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_8" data-id="GN40_8">They said to him, "We have both dreamed a dream and no one can interpret it." Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me, please."</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_9" data-id="GN40_9">The chief of the cupbearers told his dream to Joseph. He said to him, "In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_10" data-id="GN40_10">In the vine were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms came out and the clusters of grapes ripened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_11" data-id="GN40_11">Pharaoh's cup was in my hand. I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I placed the cup into Pharaoh's hand."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_12" data-id="GN40_12">Joseph said to him, "This is the interpretation of it. The three branches are three days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_13" data-id="GN40_13">Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office. You will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand, just as when you were his cupbearer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_14" data-id="GN40_14">But think of me when it goes well with you, and please show kindness to me. Mention me to Pharaoh and bring me out of this prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_15" data-id="GN40_15">For indeed I was abducted out of the land of the Hebrews. Here also have I done nothing that they should put me in this dungeon."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_16" data-id="GN40_16">When the chief of the bakers saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I also had a dream, and, behold, three baskets of bread were on my head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_17" data-id="GN40_17">In the top basket there were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds ate them out of the basket on my head."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_18" data-id="GN40_18">Joseph answered and said, "This is the interpretation. The three baskets are three days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_19" data-id="GN40_19">Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree. The birds will eat your flesh off you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_20" data-id="GN40_20">It came about on the third day that it was Pharaoh's birthday. He made a feast for all his servants. He lifted up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers, among his servants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_21" data-id="GN40_21">He restored the chief of the cupbearers to his responsibility, and he put the cup into Pharaoh's hand again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_22" data-id="GN40_22">But he hanged the chief of the bakers, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.</span>
