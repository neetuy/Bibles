<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_1" data-id="AC25_1">Now, Festus entered the province, and after three days, he went from Caesarea up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_2" data-id="AC25_2">The chief priest and the prominent Jews brought accusations against Paul, and they urged him</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_3" data-id="AC25_3">and asked him for a favor that would put Paul in dangerâ€”that Festus might summon Paul to Jerusalem so that they could kill him along the way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_4" data-id="AC25_4">Festus answered that Paul was being held at Caesarea, and that he himself was going there soon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_5" data-id="AC25_5">"Therefore, those who can," he said, "should go there with us. If there is something wrong with the man, you should accuse him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_6" data-id="AC25_6">Festus stayed not more than eight or ten days and then he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat in the judgment seat and commanded Paul to be brought to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_7" data-id="AC25_7">When he arrived, the Jews from Jerusalem stood nearby, and they brought many serious charges which they could not prove.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_8" data-id="AC25_8">Paul defended himself and said, "I have done nothing wrong against the law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_9" data-id="AC25_9">But Festus wanted to gain the favor of the Jews, and so he answered Paul and said, "Do you want to go up to Jerusalem and to be judged by me about these things there?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_10" data-id="AC25_10">Paul said, "I stand before the judgment seat of Caesar where I must be judged. I have wronged no Jews, just as you also very well know.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_11" data-id="AC25_11">Though if I have done wrong and if I have done what is worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if their accusations are nothing, no one may hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_12" data-id="AC25_12">After Festus talked with the council, he answered, "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_13" data-id="AC25_13">Now after some days, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay an official visit to Festus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_14" data-id="AC25_14">After he had been there for many days, Festus presented Paul's case to the king; he said, "A certain man was left behind here by Felix as a prisoner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_15" data-id="AC25_15">When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against this man to me, and they asked for a sentence of condemnation against him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_16" data-id="AC25_16">I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to hand over anyone before the accused had faced his accusers and had an opportunity to defend himself against the charges.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_17" data-id="AC25_17">Therefore, when they came together here, I did not wait, but the next day I sat in the judgment seat and I ordered the man to be brought in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_18" data-id="AC25_18">When the accusers stood up and accused him, I thought that none of the charges that they brought against him were serious.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_19" data-id="AC25_19">Instead, they had certain disputes with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who was dead, whom Paul claims to be alive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_20" data-id="AC25_20">I was not certain about how to investigate this matter, and so I asked him if he was willing to go to Jerusalem to stand trial there about these charges.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_21" data-id="AC25_21">But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody while awaiting the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held in custody until I could send him to Caesar."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_22" data-id="AC25_22">Agrippa spoke to Festus, "I would also like to listen to this man." "Tomorrow," Festus said, "you will hear him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_23" data-id="AC25_23">So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with much ceremony; they came into the hall with the military officers and with the prominent men of the city. When Festus spoke the command, Paul was brought to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_24" data-id="AC25_24">Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all you men who are here with us, you see this man; all the multitude of Jews consulted with me in Jerusalem and here also, and they shouted to me that he should no longer live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_25" data-id="AC25_25">I learned that he had done nothing worthy of death; but because he appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_26" data-id="AC25_26">But I do not have something definite to write to the emperor. For this reason, I have brought him to you, especially to you, King Agrippa, so that I might have something more to write about the case.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC25_27" data-id="AC25_27">For it seems unreasonable for me to send a prisoner and to not also state the charges against him."</span>
