<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_1" data-id="GL1_1">Paul, an apostle—not an apostle from men nor by human agency, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_2" data-id="GL1_2">and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_3" data-id="GL1_3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_4" data-id="GL1_4">who gave himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_5" data-id="GL1_5">to him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_6" data-id="GL1_6">I am amazed that you are turning away so quickly from him who called you by the grace of Christ. I am amazed that you are turning to a different gospel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_7" data-id="GL1_7">not that there is another gospel, but there are some men who cause you trouble and want to change the gospel of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_8" data-id="GL1_8">But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, let him be cursed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_9" data-id="GL1_9">As we have said before, so now I say again, "If someone proclaims to you a gospel other than the one you received, let him be cursed."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_10" data-id="GL1_10">For am I now seeking the approval of men or God? Am I seeking to please men? If I am still trying to please men, I am not a servant of Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_11" data-id="GL1_11">For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I proclaimed is not man's gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_12" data-id="GL1_12">I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it. Instead, it was by revelation of Jesus Christ to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_13" data-id="GL1_13">You have heard about my former life in Judaism, how I was persecuting the church of God beyond measure and that I was trying to destroy it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_14" data-id="GL1_14">I advanced in Judaism beyond many of those who were my own age, from out of my own people. That is how extremely zealous I was for the traditions of my fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_15" data-id="GL1_15">But when God, who had set me apart from my mother's womb, and who called me through his grace,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_16" data-id="GL1_16">was pleased to reveal his Son in me, so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_17" data-id="GL1_17">I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me. Instead, I went to Arabia and then returned to Damascus.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_18" data-id="GL1_18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas and I stayed with him fifteen days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_19" data-id="GL1_19">But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_20" data-id="GL1_20">In what I write to you, I assure you before God, that I am not lying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_21" data-id="GL1_21">Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_22" data-id="GL1_22">I was still not personally known to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_23" data-id="GL1_23">They only heard it being said, "The man who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_24" data-id="GL1_24">So they glorified God because of me.</span>
