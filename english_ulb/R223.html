All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and the singers were playing musical instruments and leading the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R223_14" data-id="R223_14">Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the commanders of hundreds who were over the army and said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks; anyone who follows her, let him be killed with the sword."

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R223_15" data-id="R223_15">So they seized her as she went into the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king's house, and there they killed her.</span>
