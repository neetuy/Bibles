<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_1" data-id="S113_1">Saul was thirty years old when he began to reign; when he had reigned forty years over Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_2" data-id="S113_2">he chose three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with him in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, while a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin.

<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_4" data-id="S113_4">All Israel heard that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become a rotten smell to the Philistines. Then the soldiers were summoned together to join Saul at Gilgal.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_5" data-id="S113_5">The Philistines gathered together to fight against Israel, with three thousand chariots, six thousand men to drive the chariots, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They came up and encamped at Michmash, east of Beth Aven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_6" data-id="S113_6">When the men of Israel saw that they were in troubleâ€”for the people were distressed, the people hid in caves, in the underbrush, in rocks, in wells, and in pits.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_9" data-id="S113_9">Saul said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings." Then he offered the burnt offering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_10" data-id="S113_10">As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering Samuel arrived. Saul went out to meet him and to greet him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_11" data-id="S113_11">Then Samuel said, "What have you done?"

<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_12" data-id="S113_12">I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of Yahweh.' So I forced myself to offer the burnt offering."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_13" data-id="S113_13">Then Samuel said to Saul, "You have acted foolishly. You have not kept the command of Yahweh your God that he gave you. For then Yahweh would have established your rule over Israel forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S113_14" data-id="S113_14">But now your rule will not continue.
