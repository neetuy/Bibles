<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_1" data-id="AC15_1">Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and taught the brothers, saying, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_2" data-id="AC15_2">This brought Paul and Barnabas into a sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas along with some others from among them were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to meet with the apostles and elders about this question.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_3" data-id="AC15_3">They therefore, being sent by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria and announced the conversion of the Gentiles. They brought great joy to all the brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_4" data-id="AC15_4">When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all the things that God had done with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_5" data-id="AC15_5">But certain men who believed, who belonged to the group of Pharisees, stood up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_6" data-id="AC15_6">So the apostles and the elders gathered together to consider this matter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_7" data-id="AC15_7">After much debate, Peter stood up and said to them,</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v AC15_7" data-id="AC15_7">"Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_8" data-id="AC15_8">God, who knows the heart, witnesses to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_9" data-id="AC15_9">and he made no distinction between us and them, making their hearts clean by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_10" data-id="AC15_10">Now therefore why do you test God, that you should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_11" data-id="AC15_11">But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they were."</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_13" data-id="AC15_13">After they stopped speaking, James answered, saying,</span>

<span class="v AC15_13" data-id="AC15_13">"Brothers, listen to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_14" data-id="AC15_14">Simon has told how God first graciously helped the Gentiles in order to take from them a people for his name.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_19" data-id="AC15_19">Therefore, my opinion is, that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_20" data-id="AC15_20">But we will write to them that they must keep away from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, and from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_21" data-id="AC15_21">For Moses has been proclaimed in every city from the ancient times and he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_22" data-id="AC15_22">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, who were leaders of the church, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_23" data-id="AC15_23">They wrote this: "From the apostles and elders, your brothers, to the Gentile brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings!</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_24" data-id="AC15_24">We have heard that certain men have gone out from us, with no orders from us, and have disturbed you with teachings that upset your souls.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_25" data-id="AC15_25">This being so, all of us have agreed to choose men and to send them to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span>

<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_27" data-id="AC15_27">Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas, who will tell you the same thing themselves in their own words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_28" data-id="AC15_28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_29" data-id="AC15_29">that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, blood, things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, it shall be well with you. Farewell."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_30" data-id="AC15_30">So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; after they gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_31" data-id="AC15_31">When they had read it, they rejoiced because of the encouragement.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_32" data-id="AC15_32">Judas and Silas, also prophets, encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_36" data-id="AC15_36">After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return now and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are."</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_37" data-id="AC15_37">Barnabas wanted to also take with them John who was called Mark.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_38" data-id="AC15_38">But Paul thought it was not good to take Mark, who had left them in Pamphylia and did not go further with them in the work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_39" data-id="AC15_39">Then there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_40" data-id="AC15_40">But Paul chose Silas and left, after he was entrusted by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.</span>
