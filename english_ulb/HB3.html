<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_1" data-id="HB3_1">Therefore, holy brothers, you share in a heavenly calling. Think about Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_2" data-id="HB3_2">He was faithful to God, who appointed him, just as Moses was also faithful in God's house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_3" data-id="HB3_3">For Jesus has been considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, because the one who builds a house has more honor than the house itself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_4" data-id="HB3_4">For every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_5" data-id="HB3_5">For Moses was faithful as a servant in God's entire house, bearing witness about the things that were to be spoken of in the future.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_6" data-id="HB3_6">But Christ is faithful as a Son who is in charge of God's house. We are his house if we hold fast to our courage and the hope of which we boast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_7" data-id="HB3_7">Therefore, it is just as the Holy Spirit says:</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_13" data-id="HB3_13">Instead, encourage one another daily, as long as it is called "today," so that no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_14" data-id="HB3_14">For we have become partners of Christ if we firmly hold to our confidence in him from the beginning to the end.</span>
