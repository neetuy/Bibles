<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_1" data-id="JM4_1">Where do quarrels and disputes among you come from? Do they not come from your desires that fight among your members?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_2" data-id="JM4_2">You desire, and you do not have. You kill and covet, and you are not able to obtain. You fight and quarrel. You do not possess because you do not ask.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_3" data-id="JM4_3">You ask and do not receive because you ask badly, in order that you may use it for your desires.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_4" data-id="JM4_4">You adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility against God? So whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_5" data-id="JM4_5">Or do you think the scripture says in vain, "The Spirit he caused to live in us is deeply jealous"?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_6" data-id="JM4_6">But God gives more grace, so the scripture says, "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_7" data-id="JM4_7">So submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_8" data-id="JM4_8">Come close to God, and he will come close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_9" data-id="JM4_9">Grieve, mourn, and cry! Let your laughter turn into sadness and your joy into gloom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_10" data-id="JM4_10">Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_11" data-id="JM4_11">Do not speak against one another, brothers. The person who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. If you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_12" data-id="JM4_12">Only one is the lawgiver and judge. He is the one who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you, you who judge your neighbor?</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_13" data-id="JM4_13">Now listen, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into this city, spend a year there, trade, and make a profit."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_14" data-id="JM4_14">Who knows what will happen tomorrow, and what is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little while and then disappears.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_15" data-id="JM4_15">Instead, you should say, "If the Lord wishes, we will live and do this or that."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_16" data-id="JM4_16">But now you are boasting about your arrogant plans. All such boasting is evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_17" data-id="JM4_17">So for anyone who knows to do good but does not do it, for him it is sin.</span>
