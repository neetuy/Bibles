<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_1" data-id="HB10_1">For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the real forms of those things themselves. Those who approach God can never be made perfect by the same sacrifices that the priests continually bring year after year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_2" data-id="HB10_2">Otherwise, would the sacrifices not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed one time and would no longer have any consciousness of sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_3" data-id="HB10_3">But with those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_4" data-id="HB10_4">For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</span>

<div class="q2">
<span class="v HB10_5" data-id="HB10_5">you did not desire,</div>

<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_7" data-id="HB10_7">Then I said, 'See, here I am—</span>

Nor did you take pleasure in them." These are sacrifices that are offered according to the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_9" data-id="HB10_9">Then he said, "See, here I am to do your will." He takes away the first practice in order to establish the second practice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_10" data-id="HB10_10">By that will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_11" data-id="HB10_11">Day after day every priest stands and performs his service to God. He offers the same sacrifices again and again—sacrifices that can never take away sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_12" data-id="HB10_12">But when Christ offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God.</span>

<span class="v HB10_16" data-id="HB10_16">after those days, says the Lord.</div>

<span class="v HB10_16" data-id="HB10_16">I will put my laws in their hearts,</div>

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_18" data-id="HB10_18">Now where there is forgiveness for these, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_19" data-id="HB10_19">Therefore, brothers, we have confidence to enter into the most holy place by the blood of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_20" data-id="HB10_20">That is the new and living way that he has opened for us through the curtain, that is, by means of his flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_21" data-id="HB10_21">Because we have a great priest over the house of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_22" data-id="HB10_22">let us approach with true hearts in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_23" data-id="HB10_23">Let us also hold tightly to the confession of our hope without wavering, because God, who has promised, is faithful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_24" data-id="HB10_24">Let us consider how to motivate one another to love and good deeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_25" data-id="HB10_25">Let us not stop meeting together, as some have done. Instead, encourage one another more and more, and all the more as you see the day coming closer.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_26" data-id="HB10_26">For if we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, a sacrifice for sins no longer exists.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_27" data-id="HB10_27">Instead, there is only a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume God's enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_28" data-id="HB10_28">Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_29" data-id="HB10_29">How much worse punishment do you think one deserves who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, who treated the blood of the covenant as unholy—the blood by which he was sanctified—and insulted the Spirit of grace?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_30" data-id="HB10_30">For we know the one who said, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay back." And again, "The Lord will judge his people."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_31" data-id="HB10_31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_32" data-id="HB10_32">But remember the former days, after you were enlightened, how you endured a great struggle in suffering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_33" data-id="HB10_33">You were exposed to public ridicule by insults and persecution, and you were sharing with those who went through such suffering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_34" data-id="HB10_34">For you had compassion on those who were prisoners, and you accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions. You knew that you yourselves had a better and everlasting possession. <span class="note" id="footnote-318"><a href="#note-318" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_35" data-id="HB10_35">So do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_36" data-id="HB10_36">For you need patience, so that you may receive what God has promised, after you have done his will.</span>
