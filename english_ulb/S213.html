<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_1" data-id="S213_1">It came about after this that Amnon son of David was very attracted to his beautiful half-sister Tamar, who was a full sister of Absalom, another of David's sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_2" data-id="S213_2">Amnon was so frustrated that he became sick because of his sister Tamar. She was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_3" data-id="S213_3">But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_4" data-id="S213_4">Jonadab said to Amnon, "Why, son of the king, are you depressed every morning? Will you not tell me?" So Amnon answered him, "I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_5" data-id="S213_5">Then Jonadab said to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, ask him, 'Would you please send my sister Tamar to give me something to eat and cook it before me, so that I may see it and eat it from her hand?'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_6" data-id="S213_6">So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please send my sister Tamar to make some food for my sickness in front of me so that I may eat from her hand."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_7" data-id="S213_7">Then David sent word to Tamar at his palace, saying, "Go now to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_8" data-id="S213_8">So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house where he was lying down. She took dough and kneaded it and formed bread in his sight, and then she baked it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_9" data-id="S213_9">She took the pan and gave the bread to him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said to the others present, "Send everyone out, away from me." So everyone went out from him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_10" data-id="S213_10">So Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into my room that I may eat from your hand." So Tamar took the bread that she had made, and brought it into the room of Amnon her brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_11" data-id="S213_11">When she had brought the food to him, he took hold of her and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_12" data-id="S213_12">She answered him, "No, my brother, do not force me, for nothing like this should be done in Israel. Do not do this appalling thing!</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_13" data-id="S213_13">How could I be rid of my shame? What about you? You would be like one of the fools in Israel! Now, please speak to the king, for he would not keep me from you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_14" data-id="S213_14">However Amnon would not listen to her, and he was stronger than she was, and he overpowered her, and he lay with her.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_15" data-id="S213_15">Then Amnon hated Tamar with extreme hatred. He hated her even more than he had desired her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and go."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_16" data-id="S213_16">But she responded to him, "No! Because this great evil of making me leave is even worse than what you did to me!" But Amnon did not listen to her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_17" data-id="S213_17">Instead, he called his personal servant and said, "Take this woman away from me, and bolt the door after her."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_18" data-id="S213_18">Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her. Tamar was wearing a very decorated robe because the king's daughters who were virgins dressed that way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_19" data-id="S213_19">Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her robe. She put her hands on her head and walked away, crying aloud as she went.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_20" data-id="S213_20">Absalom her brother said to her, "Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep quiet, my sister. He is your brother. Do not take this thing to heart." So Tamar remained alone in her brother Absalom's house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_21" data-id="S213_21">But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_22" data-id="S213_22">Absalom said nothing to Amnon, for Absalom hated him for what he had done to her and how he had disgraced his sister Tamar.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_23" data-id="S213_23">It came about after two full years that Absalom had sheep shearers working at Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons to visit there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_24" data-id="S213_24">Absalom went to the king and said, "Look now, your servant has sheep shearers. Please, may the king and his servants go with me, your servant."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_25" data-id="S213_25">The king answered Absalom, "No, my son, all of us should not go because we would be a burden to you." Absalom begged the king, but he would not go, but he gave him his blessing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_26" data-id="S213_26">Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us." So the king said to him, "Why should Amnon go with you?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_27" data-id="S213_27">Absalom pressed David, and so he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_28" data-id="S213_28">Absalom commanded his servants saying, "Listen closely. When Amnon begins to be affected by the wine, and when I say to you, 'Attack Amnon,' then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and brave."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_29" data-id="S213_29">So Absalom's servants did to Amnon as he had commanded them. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man mounted his mule and fled.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_30" data-id="S213_30">So it came about, while they were on the road, that the news came to David saying, "Absalom has killed all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_31" data-id="S213_31">Then the king arose and tore his clothes, and lay on the floor; all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_32" data-id="S213_32">Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, "Let not my master believe that they have killed all the young men who are the king's sons, for Amnon only is dead. Absalom has planned this from the day that Amnon violated his sister Tamar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_33" data-id="S213_33">So therefore let not my master the king take this report to heart, so as to believe that all the king's sons are dead, for Amnon only is dead."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_34" data-id="S213_34">Absalom fled away. A servant keeping watch raised his eyes and saw many people coming on the road on the hillside west of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_35" data-id="S213_35">Then Jonadab said to the king, "Look, the king's sons are coming. It is just as your servant said."</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_36" data-id="S213_36">So it came about when he finished speaking, the king's sons arrived and raised their voices and wept. The king and all his servants also wept bitterly.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_37" data-id="S213_37">But Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_38" data-id="S213_38">So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, where he was for three years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_39" data-id="S213_39">The mind of King David longed to go out to see Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon and his death.</span>
