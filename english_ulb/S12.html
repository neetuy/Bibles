<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_13" data-id="S12_13">The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand, while the meat was boiling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_14" data-id="S12_14">He would stick it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. They did this in Shiloh with all the Israelites that came there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_15" data-id="S12_15">Worse, before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who was sacrificing, "Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_16" data-id="S12_16">If the man said to him, "They must burn the fat first, and then take as much as you want." Then he would say, "No, you will give it me now; if not, I will take it by force."</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_20" data-id="S12_20">Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, "May Yahweh give you more children by this woman because of the request she made of Yahweh." Then they would return to their own home.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_22" data-id="S12_22">Now Eli was very old; he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they were lying with the women who were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_23" data-id="S12_23">He said to them, "Why do you such things? For I hear of your evil actions from all these people."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_24" data-id="S12_24">No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear. You make Yahweh's people disobey.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_27" data-id="S12_27">Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "Yahweh says, 'Did I not reveal myself to the house of your ancestor, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_28" data-id="S12_28">I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, and to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me. I gave to the house of your ancestor all the offerings of the people of Israel made with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_29" data-id="S12_29">Why, then, do you scorn my sacrifices and offerings that I required in the place where I live? Why do you honor your sons above me by making yourselves fat with the best of every offering of my people Israel?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_30" data-id="S12_30">For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'I promised that your house, and the house of your ancestor, should walk before me forever.' But now Yahweh says, 'Far be it from me to do this, for I will honor those who honor me, but those who despise me will be lightly esteemed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_31" data-id="S12_31">See, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will no longer be any old man in your house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_32" data-id="S12_32">You will see distress in the place where I live. Although good will be given to Israel, there will no longer be any old man in your house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_33" data-id="S12_33">Any one of you that I do not cut off from my altar, I will cause your eyes to fail, and I will cause grief for your life. All the men born in your family will die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_34" data-id="S12_34">This will be the sign for you that will come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: They will both die on the same day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_35" data-id="S12_35">I will raise up for myself a faithful priest who will do what is in my heart and in my soul. I will build him a sure house; and he will walk before my anointed king forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_36" data-id="S12_36">Everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him, asking for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, "Please assign me to one of the priests' positions so I can eat a piece of bread."'"</span>
