<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_15" data-id="R235_15">The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were in their place, as directed by David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer, and the guards were at every gate.

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_20" data-id="R235_20">After all this, after Josiah had set the temple in order, Necho, king of Egypt, went up to fight against Carchemish at the Euphrates River, and Josiah went to fight against him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_21" data-id="R235_21">But Necho sent ambassadors to him, saying, "What have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am making war.

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_22" data-id="R235_22">However, Josiah refused to turn away from him. He disguised himself in order to fight with him.

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_23" data-id="R235_23">Archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am badly wounded."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_24" data-id="R235_24">So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in his extra chariot. They took him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_25" data-id="R235_25">Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; all the male and female singers lament about Josiah to this day. These songs became customary in Israel; behold, they are written in the songs of lament.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_26" data-id="R235_26">As for the other matters concerning Josiah, and his good deeds done in obedience to what is written in the law of Yahwehâ€”</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_27" data-id="R235_27">and his deeds, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span>
