<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_4" data-id="EK2_4">Their descendants have stubborn faces and hard hearts. I am sending you to them, and you will say to them, 'This is what the Lord Yahweh says.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_5" data-id="EK2_5">Either they will listen or they will not listen. They are a rebellious house, but they will at least know that a prophet has been among them.</span>
