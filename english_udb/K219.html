<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_2" data-id="K219_2">Then he summoned Eliakim and Shebna and the older priests, who were also wearing clothes made of rough sackcloth, and told them to talk to Isaiah the prophet, son of Amoz.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_3" data-id="K219_3">He said to them to say these things to Isaiah: "King Hezekiah says that this is a day when we have great distress. Other nations are causing us to be insulted and disgraced like a woman who is about to give birth to a child, but she is not strong enough to do it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_4" data-id="K219_4">Perhaps Yahweh our God has heard everything that the official from Assyria said. Perhaps he knows that his master, the king of Assyria, sent him to insult the all-powerful God and that Yahweh will punish him for what he said. And Hezekiah requests that you pray for the few of us who are still alive here in Jerusalem."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_5" data-id="K219_5">When the messengers from Hezekiah came to Isaiah, and</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_6" data-id="K219_6">Isaiah instructed them to go back to their master and tell him what Yahweh says: "Those messengers from the king of Assyria have said evil things about me. But you should not be disturbed because of what they said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_7" data-id="K219_7">Listen to this: I will cause Sennacherib to hear a rumor that will worry him, that other armies are about to attack his country. So he will return to his own country, and there I will cause him to be assassinated by some men."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_8" data-id="K219_8">The official from Assyria found out that the King of Assyria and his army had left the city of Lachish, and that they were attacking Libnah, which was a nearby city. So the official went there to report to him what had happened in Jerusalem.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_9" data-id="K219_9">Soon after that, King Sennacherib received a report that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was leading his army to attack them. But before King Sennacherib left Libnah to fight against the army from Ethiopia, he sent other messengers to King Hezekiah with a letter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_10" data-id="K219_10">In the letter he wrote this to Hezekiah: "Do not allow your god on whom you are relying to deceive you by promising that my army will never capture Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_11" data-id="K219_11">You have certainly heard what the armies of the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries. Our armies have completely destroyed them. So do you think that you will escape?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_12" data-id="K219_12">Did the gods of the nations that were about to be destroyed by the armies of the previous kings of Assyria rescue them? Did those gods rescue the people in the region of Gozan or in the cities of Haran and Rezeph in northern Aram? Did they rescue the people of Eden who had been deported to the city of Tel Assar? None of the gods of those cities was able to rescue them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_13" data-id="K219_13">What happened to the kings of the cities of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, and Ivvah? They are all dead."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_14" data-id="K219_14">Hezekiah received the letter that the messengers gave him, and he read it. Then he went up to the temple and spread out the letter in front of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_15" data-id="K219_15">Then Hezekiah prayed this: "Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong, you are seated on your throne above the statues of creatures with wings, above the sacred chest. Only you are truly God. You rule all the kingdoms on this earth. You are the one who created everything on the earth and in the sky.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_16" data-id="K219_16">So, Yahweh, please listen to what I am saying, and look at what is happening. And listen to what King Sennacherib has said to insult you, the all-powerful God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_17" data-id="K219_17">Yahweh, it is true that the armies of the kings of Assyria have completely destroyed many nations and ruined their lands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_18" data-id="K219_18">And they have thrown the idols of those nations into fires and burned them. But that was not difficult to do, because they were not gods. They were only statues made of wood and stone, idols that were shaped by humans, and that is why they were destroyed easily.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_19" data-id="K219_19">So now, Yahweh our God, please rescue us from the power of the king of Assyria, in order that the people in all the kingdoms of the world may know that you, Yahweh, are the only one who is truly God."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_20" data-id="K219_20">Then Isaiah sent this message to Hezekiah to tell him what Yahweh, the God to whom the Israelites belonged, said in response: "I have heard what you prayed to me about Sennacherib, the king of Assyria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_21" data-id="K219_21">This is what I say to that king:</span>
