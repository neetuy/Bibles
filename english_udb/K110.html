<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K110_2" data-id="K110_2">She came with a large group of wealthy people, and she brought camels that were loaded with spices, precious gems, and much gold. When she met Solomon, she asked him questions about all the things in which she was interested.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K110_3" data-id="K110_3">Solomon answered all her questions. He explained everything that she asked about, even things that were very difficult.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K110_6" data-id="K110_6">She said to the king, "Everything that I heard in my own country about you and about how wise you are is true!</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K110_7" data-id="K110_7">But I did not believe it was true until I came here and saw it myself. But really, what they told me is only half of what they could have told me about you. You are extremely wise and rich, more than what people told me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K110_8" data-id="K110_8">How fortunate are your wives! And how fortunate are your servants, who are waiting to serve you, who are listening to the wise things that you say!</span>
