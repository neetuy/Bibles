<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_1" data-id="JS18_1">The entire assembly of the people of Israel met together at Shiloh. There they set up the tent where they worshiped Yahweh. There was no more war in the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_2" data-id="JS18_2">However, there seven tribes of Israel had not yet been assigned any land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_3" data-id="JS18_3">Joshua said to the people of Israel, "Why are you waiting such a long time? How long are you going to delay going into the land that Yahweh, the God whom your ancestors worshiped, has promised to give to you?</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_4" data-id="JS18_4">Choose three men from each of your seven tribes. I will send them out to explore the parts of the land which you have not occupied yet. When they finish, they will write a report to tell you what the land is like. They will also make a map to show you where cities and important places are located and which tribe will live in which area.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_5" data-id="JS18_5">They will divide the remaining land into seven parts. The tribe of Judah will keep its land in the south, and the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh will keep their land in the north.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_6" data-id="JS18_6">But in their report, the men from the seven tribes should describe the seven parts of the remaining land that they wish to receive, and bring the report to me. While Yahweh is watching, I will cast lots to decide which land should be assigned to each tribe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_7" data-id="JS18_7">But the tribe of Levi will not be assigned any land, because their reward is to be Yahweh's priests. The tribes of Gad, Reuben, and the half tribe of Manasseh have already been assigned their land on the east side of the Jordan River, just as Moses, the man who served God well, decided, so they will not get any more land."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_8" data-id="JS18_8">When the men who were chosen got ready to leave, Joshua told them, "Go and explore the land. Then write a report of what you have seen, and bring it back to me. Then while Yahweh is watching, I will cast lots here at Shiloh, to determine what area each tribe will receive."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_9" data-id="JS18_9">So the men left and walked through the area. Then they described in a scroll each of the seven parts into which they had divided the land, together with their cities. Then they returned to Joshua, who was still at Shiloh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_10" data-id="JS18_10">After Joshua read their report, while Yahweh was watching, he cast lots to choose which land would be assigned to each of the seven Israelite tribes.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS18_11" data-id="JS18_11">The first tribe that was assigned land was the tribe of Benjamin. Each clan in that tribe was assigned some of the land that was between the area that was assigned to the tribe of Judah and the area that was assigned to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.</span>
