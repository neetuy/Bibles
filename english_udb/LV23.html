<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_4" data-id="LV23_4">There are festivals that I am establishing for you. These will be sacred days when you must gather together to worship me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_9" data-id="LV23_9">Yahweh also told Moses</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_10" data-id="LV23_10">to tell the Israelite people about other festivals. He said, "After you arrive in the land which I am giving to you, and when you harvest your crops for the first time there, bring to the priest some of the first grain that you harvest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_11" data-id="LV23_11">On the day after the next Sabbath day, the priest will lift it up high to dedicate it to me, in order that I may accept it as your gift.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_12" data-id="LV23_12">On that same day you must sacrifice to me a one year old male lamb that has no defects. You must burn it on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_13" data-id="LV23_13">You must also burn a flour offering. That offering must consist of four and one-half liters of good flour, ground grain, mixed with olive oil. The smell of those things burning will be very pleasing to me. Along with that, you must also offer one liter of wine, which will be a liquid offering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_14" data-id="LV23_14">Do not eat any bread or any roasted or unroasted grain on that day until after you have brought those offerings to me, your God.

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_15" data-id="LV23_15">Count seven weeks and one day after the priest offers that bundle of grain to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_16" data-id="LV23_16">Then on the day after the seventh Sabbath, each family must bring to me an offering from the new crop of grain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_17" data-id="LV23_17">From your homes, bring two loaves of bread to the priest. He will lift them up high to dedicate them as an offering to me. Those loaves must be baked from four and one-half liters of good flour that has yeast mixed with it. That bread will be an offering to me from the first wheat that you harvest each year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_18" data-id="LV23_18">Along with this bread, you must present to me seven one year old lambs with no defects, one young bull, and two rams. They must all be completely burned on the altar. All those offerings, with the flour offering and the wine offering, will be burned, and the smell of all those things burning will be very pleasing to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_19" data-id="LV23_19">Then you must also kill one male goat as an offering for your sins, and two one year old male lambs to be an offering for you to promise friendship with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_20" data-id="LV23_20">The priest will lift up these offerings high to dedicate them to me.

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_21" data-id="LV23_21">On that day, you must stop your regular work and gather to worship me. You and all your descendants must always obey these commands, wherever you live.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_22" data-id="LV23_22">When you harvest the grain in your fields, do not harvest what is along the edges of the fields, and do not pick up the grain that the harvesters drop. Leave it for the poor people and for the foreigners who are living among you. Do not forget that it is I, Yahweh your God, who am commanding those things!"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_23" data-id="LV23_23">Yahweh also told Moses</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_24" data-id="LV23_24">to give these instructions to the Israelite people: "Each year in the seventh month, on the first day of that month, all of you must celebrate that day, on which you will completely rest. You must not do any work on that day. When the priests blow their trumpets loudly, you all must gather together as a holy assembly, to worship me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_25" data-id="LV23_25">All of you must not do any regular work on that day. Instead, you must present offerings to me that will be burned on the altar."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_26" data-id="LV23_26">Yahweh also said to Moses,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_27" data-id="LV23_27">"You must celebrate a day on which you request that I forgive you for the sins that you have committed. That day will be nine days after the festival when the priests blow the trumpets. On that day you must not eat. You must gather together to worship me and present offerings to me that will be burned on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_28" data-id="LV23_28">You must not do any work on that day, because it is the Day of Atonement, when the priests will offer sacrifices to me to atone for your sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_29" data-id="LV23_29">You must drive out from the people anyone who does not go without eating on that day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_30" data-id="LV23_30">I will get rid of anyone who does any kind of work on that day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_31" data-id="LV23_31">You must not work at all! You and all your descendants must always obey these commands, wherever you live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_32" data-id="LV23_32">That day will be a day of complete rest for all of you, and on that day you must fast to show that you are sorry for having sinned. That day of rest and going without food will begin on the evening before the day in which you ask me to forgive you for your sins, and it will end on the evening of the following day."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_33" data-id="LV23_33">Yahweh also said to Moses,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_34" data-id="LV23_34">"Tell the Israelite people that each year they must also celebrate the Festival of Shelters. That festival will begin five days after the Day of Atonement. This festival will last for seven days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_35" data-id="LV23_35">On the first day of that festival, the people must gather together to worship me, and they must not do any regular work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_36" data-id="LV23_36">On each of the seven days of this festival, they must present to me an offering of animals that will be burned on the altar. On the eighth day, they must gather again as a holy assembly to worship me and present to me another animal that will be burned on the altar. That also will be a sacred gathering, and they must not work on that day, either.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_37" data-id="LV23_37">To summarize, those are the festivals that I have appointed. Celebrate these festivals by gathering together to present to me all the various offerings that will be burned on the altar—animals that will be burned completely, and offerings of flour, offerings to promise friendship with me, and offerings of wine. Each offering must be brought on the day that I have indicated.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_38" data-id="LV23_38">You must celebrate these festivals in addition to worshiping me on the Sabbath days. And you must give me all those offerings in addition to the offerings that people personally decide to give, and in addition to the offerings that people make to accompany the solemn promises that they have made.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_39" data-id="LV23_39">Returning to my instructions about the Festival of Shelters, you must celebrate this festival after you have harvested all the crops. On the first day and on the last day of that festival, you must rest completely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_40" data-id="LV23_40">But on the first day, you are permitted to pick the best fruit from trees. You will also take branches from the palm trees, leafy branches from other trees, and willow trees near the stream, and make shelters to live in for that week. Then rejoice in my presence for those seven days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_41" data-id="LV23_41">You must celebrate this festival for seven days every year. You and all your descendants must always obey these commands, wherever you live. You must celebrate this festival in the seventh month.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_42" data-id="LV23_42">During the seven days of that festival, all of you people who have been Israelites all of your lives must live in shelters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_43" data-id="LV23_43">This festival will always remind your descendants that their ancestors lived in shelters for many years after I rescued them from Egypt. Do not forget that I, Yahweh your God, am the one who is commanding this."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV23_44" data-id="LV23_44">So Moses gave to the Israelite people all these instructions concerning the festivals that Yahweh wanted them to celebrate each year.</span>
