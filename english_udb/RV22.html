<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_1" data-id="RV22_1">Then the angel showed me the river that causes people who drink from it to live forever. The water was sparkling and clear like crystal. The river was flowing out from the throne where God and the Lamb were sitting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_2" data-id="RV22_2">It flowed down through the middle of the main street of the city. On each side of the river were trees with fruit that causes people who eat it to live forever. The trees bear twelve kinds of fruit; they produce one crop each month. The people groups use the leaves of the trees as medicine in order that their wounds may heal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_3" data-id="RV22_3">There will never be anyone or anything there that God will curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city. God's servants will worship him there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_4" data-id="RV22_4">They will see him face to face, and his name will be written on their foreheads.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_5" data-id="RV22_5">There will never again be night. God's servants will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun because the Lord God will shine his light upon them. They will rule forever.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_6" data-id="RV22_6">The angel said to me: "These things that God has shown you are true, and he will certainly make them happen. The Lord God who inspires the prophets sent his angel to show the people who serve him the events that must happen soon."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_7" data-id="RV22_7">Jesus says to all his people, "Listen to this! I am coming soon; God will abundantly bless everyone who obeys the message that has been written in this book."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_8" data-id="RV22_8">I, John, am the one who heard and saw in a vision these things that I have written down. When I had heard and seen them, I immediately lay down in front of the angel who had shown me these things in order to worship him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_9" data-id="RV22_9">But he said to me, "Do not worship me! I am just a servant of God like you! I am also a servant like your fellow believers who are the prophets, and like those who obey the message in this book. Instead, worship God!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_10" data-id="RV22_10">He also said to me, "Do not keep secret the message about what God has foretold in this book because it is almost time for him to fulfill this message.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_11" data-id="RV22_11">Since that time is near, if those who act in an evil manner want to continue to act that way, let them continue to do so. God will soon pay them back for that. If those who are vile want to continue to be vile, let them continue to do so. God will soon pay them back for that. Those who are acting righteously should continue to act righteously. Those who are perfect should continue to be perfect."</span>

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_14" data-id="RV22_14">God is very pleased with the people who wash their robes and make them clean because they will be able to eat the fruit of the tree that enables people to live forever and because they will be able to enter the gates into the holy city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_15" data-id="RV22_15">Outside are people who are unholy. They include people who practice witchcraft, people who sin sexually, people who murder others, idol worshipers, and all people who enjoy telling lies and are continual liars. They can never enter that city."</span>
