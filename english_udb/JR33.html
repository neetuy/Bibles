<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_1" data-id="JR33_1">While Jeremiah was still being guarded in the courtyard of the palace, Yahweh gave him this second message:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_2" data-id="JR33_2">"This is what I, the one who made the earth, who formed it and put it in its place, say to the people of Jerusalem: 'My name is Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_3" data-id="JR33_3">Call out to me, and then I will tell you great and wonderful things that you have not known before.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_4" data-id="JR33_4">This is what I, Yahweh, the God of Israel, say: 'The men in this city have torn down some of their houses, and even parts of the king's palace, to get materials to strengthen the walls around the city, in order that the soldiers of Babylonia would not be able to break through the walls after they climb up the ramps that they have built against the walls, and kill the inhabitants with their swords.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_5" data-id="JR33_5">You are expecting to fight against the army from Babylonia, but what will happen is that the houses of this city will be filled with the corpses of the men of this city whom I will allow to be killed because I am extremely angry with them. I have abandoned them because of all the wicked things that they have done.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_6" data-id="JR33_6">However, there will be a time when I will cause the people in this city to be healthy and strong again. I will enable them to be prosperous and have peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_7" data-id="JR33_7">I will bring the people of Judah and Israel back from the lands to which they were exiled. I will enable them to rebuild their towns.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_8" data-id="JR33_8">I will get rid of their guilt for all the sins that they have committed against me, and I will forgive them for their sin of rebelling against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_9" data-id="JR33_9">When that happens, all the nations of the world will rejoice, and they will praise me and honor me. They will hear about all the good things that I have done for this city and, because of that, they will revere me, and they will tremble because I have caused the people in this city to have peace and to prosper.'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_10" data-id="JR33_10">And this is also what I, Yahweh, say: 'You people have said that this is a land where there are no longer any people or animals. But in the streets of Jerusalem that are now completely empty, and in the other towns in Judah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_11" data-id="JR33_11">some day people will again be happy and laugh. Brides and bridegrooms will again sing joyfully. And many other people will also sing joyfully as they bring their offerings to me to thank me for what I have done for them. They will sing this song:</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JR33_11" data-id="JR33_11">"We thank you, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR33_11" data-id="JR33_11">because you are good to us.</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR33_11" data-id="JR33_11">You faithfully hold to your covenant with us forever."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JR33_11" data-id="JR33_11">They will sing that because I will cause the people of this land to be as prosperous as they were before.'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_12" data-id="JR33_12">This land is now desolate. There are no people or animals living here. But I, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, say this: 'In this land there will again be pastures where shepherds will lead their sheep</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_13" data-id="JR33_13">Shepherds will again count their sheep as the sheep walk by, outside the towns in the hill country, in the western foothills, in the southern Judean wilderness, in the land where the descendants of Benjamin live, around Jerusalem, and outside all the other towns in Judah.' That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_14" data-id="JR33_14">Listen to this! I, Yahweh, say that there will be a time when I will do for the people of Israel and Judah all the good things that I promised to do for them.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_15" data-id="JR33_15">At that time I will appoint a righteous man who will be a descendant of King David.</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR33_15" data-id="JR33_15">Throughout the land, he will do what is just and right.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_16" data-id="JR33_16">At that time, the people of Judah will be rescued from their enemies,</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR33_16" data-id="JR33_16">and the people of Jerusalem will be safe.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JR33_16" data-id="JR33_16">And people will say that the name of the city is 'Yahweh is the one who does right for us.'</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_17" data-id="JR33_17">And this is also what I, Yahweh, say: 'There will be descendants of King David ruling Israel forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_18" data-id="JR33_18">And there will always be priests who are descendants of Levi who stand in front of me and offer sacrifices that will be completely burned on the altar and who will burn food offerings and other sacrifices.'"</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_19" data-id="JR33_19">Then Yahweh gave Jeremiah this message:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_20" data-id="JR33_20">"This is what I, Yahweh, say: 'You certainly cannot annul my promise to cause nighttime to follow daytime each day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_21" data-id="JR33_21">Similarly, you cannot annul the promise that I made with King David, who served me well, that there will always be descendants of his who will rule Judah. The same is true for my agreement with the descendants of Levi who are priests who do work for me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_22" data-id="JR33_22">No one can count the stars in the sky, and no one can count the grains of sand at the seashore. Similarly, I will cause there to be a huge number of descendants of David and descendants of Levi who will work for me.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_23" data-id="JR33_23">Yahweh gave another message to me. He said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_24" data-id="JR33_24">"Surely you know that some people are saying, 'Yahweh chose two groups, the people of Judah and the people of Israel, and later abandoned them.' Thepeople who are saying this are despising my people; they are saying that Israel no longer deserves to be considered a nation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_25" data-id="JR33_25">But this is what I say: 'I will not reject my people any quicker than I will change my laws that control the day and the night, the sky and the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR33_26" data-id="JR33_26">Similarly, I will never abandon the descendants of David or the other descendants of Jacob, and I will always allow descendants of David to rule the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will bring them back to their land, and I will act mercifully toward them.'"</span>
