<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_1" data-id="ER10_1">While Ezra was kneeling down in front of the temple and praying and crying, he was confessing the sins that the Israelite people had committed. Many people, men and women and children, gathered around him and also cried very much.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_2" data-id="ER10_2">Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel in the clan of Elam, said this to him: "We have disobeyed God. Some of us have married women who are not Israelites. But we can still hope that Yahweh will be merciful to us Israelite people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_3" data-id="ER10_3">We will do what you, and the others who have an awesome respect for what our God has commanded, tell us to do. We will do what God told us in his laws. We will make a covenant with our God, saying that we will divorce our wives who are not Israelites, and we will send them away with their children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_4" data-id="ER10_4">It is your responsibility to tell us what to do. So get up, and be courageous, and do what is necessary. We will support you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_5" data-id="ER10_5">So Ezra stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests, the descendants of Levi, and all the other Israelite people solemnly declare that they would do what Shecaniah said that they should do. So they all solemnly promised to do that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_6" data-id="ER10_6">Then Ezra went away from in front of the temple and went to the room where Jehohanan lived. He stayed there that night, but he did not eat or drink anything. He was still sad because some of the Israelites who had returned from Babylonia had not faithfully obeyed God's laws.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_7" data-id="ER10_7">Then the leaders sent a message to all the people in Jerusalem and in other towns in Judah, saying that all those who had returned from Babylonia should come to Jerusalem immediately.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_8" data-id="ER10_8">The leaders also said that if any of them did not arrive within three days, they would order that all the property of those people be taken from them, and that they must no longer be considered to belong to the Israelite people; they would be considered to be foreigners.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_9" data-id="ER10_9">So within three days, all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem. They were there, sitting in the courtyard in front of the temple. They were shaking because it was raining hard and because they were worried that they would be punished for what they had done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_10" data-id="ER10_10">Then Ezra stood up and said to them, "Some of you men have committed an act of treason against God. You have married women who are not Israelites. By doing that, you have made us Israelite people more guilty than we were before.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_11" data-id="ER10_11">So now you must worship Yahweh, the God whom your ancestors worshiped, and you must do what he wants. Separate yourselves from the people of other nations and from the women from those nations whom you have married."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_12" data-id="ER10_12">The whole group answered, shouting loudly, "Yes, what you have said is right! We will do what you have said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_13" data-id="ER10_13">But we are a very large group, and it is raining hard. Also, there are many of us who have committed this evil sin. This is something that we cannot take care of in one or two days, and we cannot stand here in this rain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_14" data-id="ER10_14">So allow our leaders to decide for all of us what we should do. Tell everyone who has married a woman who is not Israelite to come at a time that you decide. They should come with the elders and judges from each city. If we do that, our God will stop being angry with us because of what we have done."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_15" data-id="ER10_15">Jonathan son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah disagreed with this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai, a descendant of Levi, supported them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_16" data-id="ER10_16">But all the others who had returned from Babylonia said that they would do it. So Ezra chose leaders of each of the clans, and I wrote down their names. On the first day of the tenth month these men came and sat down to investigate the matter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_17" data-id="ER10_17">By the first day of the first month of the next year they had finished determining which men had married women who were not Israelites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_18" data-id="ER10_18">This is a list of the names of the priests who had married non-Jewish women, and the clans to which they belonged.

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_19" data-id="ER10_19">They solemnly promised to divorce their wives, and they each sacrificed a ram to be an offering to atone for their sins.</span>
