<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_1" data-id="C25_1">We know that these bodies are only temporary dwelling places, like tents that do not last very long. But we know that when we die, God gives us a permanent place in which we will live, a body that lasts forever, a body that God has made.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_2" data-id="C25_2">While we live in our physical bodies, we groan with longing for the bodies we will have when we will live with God—</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_3" data-id="C25_3">because when God clothes us in our new bodies, that will be our covering, like clothing.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_4" data-id="C25_4">For we live in these bodies that one day will die, and we long for the day when we lay aside these bodies. Not that we are eager to die, but we are eager to be clothed with our eternal bodies, just like the saying that says, "All that dies, will be swallowed up by life."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_5" data-id="C25_5">God himself prepares our new bodies for us, and he guarantees that we will receive them by giving us his Spirit.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_6" data-id="C25_6">So you should always be certain that as long as we live in our bodies on the earth, we are away from Lord, who is in heaven</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_7" data-id="C25_7">(we live our lives by trusting in him, and not by trusting in what we can see).</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_8" data-id="C25_8">Because we have put our trust in him, we would much rather give up our present bodies so we could be at home with the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_9" data-id="C25_9">Therefore we make it our goal to obey him, whether we are here or in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_10" data-id="C25_10">For we will all stand before the Messiah when he sits as the judge of all. He will judge what we did when we were in this life. The Messiah will give us what we deserve, and he will judge what was good or bad.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_11" data-id="C25_11">Therefore we know what it is to honor the Lord, so we make sure to tell people what kind of God he is. God knows what kind of people we are, and I expect that you also understand whether we are doing good or evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_12" data-id="C25_12">We are not trying to prove again that we are genuine servants of God. We only want you to know what kind of people we are, and to give you a reason to be proud of us. We do this, so that you can answer those who praise their own actions, but do not care about what they really are in their inner being.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_13" data-id="C25_13">If people think we are crazy, well, we are serving God. But if we are in our right minds, it is to help you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_14" data-id="C25_14">Our love for the Messiah drives us on. We are sure of this: the Messiah died for all, therefore we all have died with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_15" data-id="C25_15">The Messiah died for all, so that those who live should not live for themselves, but should live for the Messiah, who died for their sins; and he is the one whom God raised from the dead.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_16" data-id="C25_16">Since we live no longer for ourselves, we judge no one according to the way the unbelievers judge. We once even viewed the Messiah by these human standards. But as Christians, now we judge no one like this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_17" data-id="C25_17">When anyone is joined with the Messiah and trusts in him, he becomes a new person. Everything from the past is gone—See!— God makes everything in you new.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_18" data-id="C25_18">All these gifts come from God. He made peace with us so that we are no longer enemies of God. Now we have peace with God through the cross of the Messiah. Also, God has given us the responsibility of announcing that he is bringing people and himself together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_19" data-id="C25_19">That message brings God and people together and is how God made peace with the world by what the Messiah did. God is not applying their sins to their account. Instead, the Messiah has taken our sins away and has given us this message that makes peace and brings God and people together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_20" data-id="C25_20">So God has appointed us to represent the Messiah. God pleads with you through us. So we plead with you on the Messiah's behalf: Through the Messiah, let him make peace with you and bring you to himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_21" data-id="C25_21">God made the Messiah the offering for sin—the one who never sinned—so that when we trust in the Messiah and believe in him, God makes us right with himself.</span>
