<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R15_1" data-id="R15_1">Reuben was the oldest son of Jacob. Therefore, he should have received the special rights that belonged to firstborn sons. But he slept with his father's slave wife, so his father gave those rights to the sons of his younger brother Joseph. And in the family records, Reuben is not mentioned first, as the firstborn sons always are.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R15_21" data-id="R15_21">They took the animals that belonged to the descendants of Hagar: They took fifty thousand camels, 250,000 sheep, and two thousand donkeys. They also captured 100,000 people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R15_22" data-id="R15_22">But many descendants of Hagar were killed because God helped the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh.

</div>
<div class="s2">These are those who lived with eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh</div>
