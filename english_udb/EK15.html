<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_2" data-id="EK15_2">"Son of man, the wood of a grapevine is certainly not more useful than the branches of the trees in a forest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_3" data-id="EK15_3">No one even makes pegs from it to hang things on.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_4" data-id="EK15_4">And after a branch of a grapevine is thrown into a fire and the fire burns both ends and chars the branch in the middle, after that will it be useful for anything?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_5" data-id="EK15_5">No; if it was not useful for anything before it was burned, it certainly cannot be made into something useful after the fire has burned and charred it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_6" data-id="EK15_6">Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: The wood of grapevines is useful only for fuel in a fire. Similarly, the people who live in Jerusalem are useless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_7" data-id="EK15_7">I will reject them. It will be as though they have escaped from a fire, but there will still be a fire that will burn them up. And when I punish them, you people who remain alive will know that I, Yahweh, have done it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_8" data-id="EK15_8">I will cause your country to become a wasteland because your people have not been loyal to me. That is what I, Yahweh, the Lord, say."</span>
