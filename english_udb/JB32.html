<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_1" data-id="JB32_1">Then those three men stopped replying to Job because they could not convince Job that he had done anything wrong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_2" data-id="JB32_2">Then Elihu son of Barakel, a descendant of Buz, from the clan of Ram, became very angry at Job. He was angry because Job continued to claim that he was innocent, and that God had been wrong to punish him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_3" data-id="JB32_3">He was also angry with Job's three friends because they had declared that Job must have done many things that were wrong, but they could not convince him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_4" data-id="JB32_4">Now Elihu was younger than the others, so he waited until they had finished speaking before he replied to Job.</span>

</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JB32_6" data-id="JB32_6">So I was timid, and I was afraid to tell you what I was thinking.</div>

<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_7" data-id="JB32_7">I said to myself, 'Let those who are much older speak</span>
