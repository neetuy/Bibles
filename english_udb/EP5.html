<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_1" data-id="EP5_1">Imitate God because he loves us, because you are his children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_2" data-id="EP5_2">Live by loving others just like the Messiah loved us when he gave himself up on the cross as the offering and sacrifice to God for our sins, which was very pleasing to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_3" data-id="EP5_3">Do not suggest any kind of immoral act and do not desire what others have or wrong things others do. Such sins can cause people to say bad things about God's people, who are together set apart for God, not for sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_4" data-id="EP5_4">Do not tell obscene stories to others or say foolish things or joke about committing sins. Such things are not what people who belong to God talk about. Instead, thank God for his love when you talk to others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_5" data-id="EP5_5">You can be sure of this: No person who is sexually immoral or indecent, or who is greedy (for this is the same as worshiping idols) will be among God's people over whom the Messiah rules as king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_6" data-id="EP5_6">Do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments. Because they do these sinful things, God will be angry with the people who disobey him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_7" data-id="EP5_7">So do not join with those who do these kinds of sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_8" data-id="EP5_8">Before you believed in the Lord Jesus, you were living in sinful disobedience, as if a dark night surrounded you all the time. But now live in the light of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_9" data-id="EP5_9">Like light produces good things, so also those who live in the light of Jesus know and do what is good, right, and true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_10" data-id="EP5_10">Test and find out what pleases the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_11" data-id="EP5_11">Do not participate together with those who are doing the worthless deeds done in spiritual darkness. Instead, just say, "Those sinful acts are worthless,"</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_12" data-id="EP5_12">because the evil things people do in the secret of darkness are too shameful to describe in the light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_13" data-id="EP5_13">Everything that light exposes can then be clearly seen and better understood</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_14" data-id="EP5_14">because the light shows what it truly is. It is like when God's word explains the sins that destroy people and Jesus who forgives and renews people. So believers say,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EP5_14" data-id="EP5_14">"Wake up from your sleep</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EP5_14" data-id="EP5_14">and arise from living like dead people.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EP5_14" data-id="EP5_14">The Messiah will enable you to understand</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EP5_14" data-id="EP5_14">his forgiveness and new life."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_15" data-id="EP5_15">So be very careful how you live. Do not behave as foolish people do. Instead, behave as wise people do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_16" data-id="EP5_16">Use the time you have on earth wisely because the days here are filled with evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_17" data-id="EP5_17">So do not be foolish. Instead, understand what the Lord Jesus wants you to do, and do it!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_18" data-id="EP5_18">Do not become drunk by drinking alcoholic drinks, which can ruin your life. Instead, let God's Spirit control what you do at all times.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_19" data-id="EP5_19">Sing to each other Psalms, and sing songs about the Messiah, and sing songs that God's Spirit gives you. Sing these Psalms and other songs from your hearts to praise the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_20" data-id="EP5_20">At all times thank God the Father for everything because of what the Lord Jesus the Messiah has done for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_21" data-id="EP5_21">Humbly submit yourselves to each other because you honor the Messiah.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">22-23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_22-23" data-id="EP5_22-23">Wives should submit to their own husband's leadership as they do to the Lord Jesus, because the husband is the leader of the wife as also the Messiah is the leader of the worldwide assembly of believers. He is the Savior who has saved all believers from being condemned for their sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_24" data-id="EP5_24">Just as all believers submit themselves to the authority of the Messiah, the women must submit themselves completely to the authority of their husbands.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_25" data-id="EP5_25">Each of you husbands, love your wife as the Messiah loved all believers and gave up his own life for us on the cross,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_26" data-id="EP5_26">so that he might set us apart for himself. By the power of his word Jesus purified believers by removing the punishment for our sins, as if he had washed us with water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_27" data-id="EP5_27">Now the Messiah can present all believers to himself as a completely clean, forgiven, faultless group, without sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_28" data-id="EP5_28">Each man should love his wife as he loves his own body. When men love their wives, it is as though they loved themselves,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">29-30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_29-30" data-id="EP5_29-30">because no one ever hated his own body. Instead, he feeds his own body and cares for it, just like the Messiah also cares for all us believers in his worldwide assembly. We have become one group of believers that belongs to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_31" data-id="EP5_31">The scriptures say this about people who marry:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EP5_31" data-id="EP5_31">"When a man and a woman marry, they should permanently leave their fathers and mothers. They should be joined as husband and wife, and the two of them will become as though they were one person."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_32" data-id="EP5_32">It is difficult to understand the meaning of these things that God has now revealed, but I am telling you about the Messiah's love for his worldwide assembly of believers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_33" data-id="EP5_33">However, as for you, each man must love his wife just as he loves himself, and each woman must respect her husband.</span>
