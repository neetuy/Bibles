<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR45_1" data-id="JR45_1">After Jehoiakim son of King Josiah had been ruling Judah for almost four years, Baruch son of Neriah wrote down all the messages that the prophet Jeremiah had dictated. Jeremiah gave a message and he said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR45_2" data-id="JR45_2">"Baruch, Yahweh, the God of Israel, has a message for you.</span>

And now Yahweh is causing me to be very sad, in addition to my having pain. I am exhausted from my groaning, and I am unable to rest!'</span>

<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR45_4" data-id="JR45_4">But Baruch, this is what Yahweh says: 'I will destroy this nation that I established. This nation is like a tree that I planted and that I will now pull up with its roots. I will do this everywhere in the world.</span>

It is true that I will cause all these people to experience a great disaster, but wherever you go, I will protect you, and you will not be killed.'"</span>
