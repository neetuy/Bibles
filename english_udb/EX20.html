<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX20_3" data-id="EX20_3">You must worship only me; you must not worship any other god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX20_4" data-id="EX20_4">You must not carve a figure to worship that represents anything in the sky or that is on the ground or that is in the water under the ground.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX20_10" data-id="EX20_10">but the seventh day is a day of rest, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh your God, the one whom you should worship. On that day you must not do any work. You and your sons and daughters and your male and female slaves must not work. You must not even force your livestock to work, and you must not allow foreigners to work, those strangers who are living in your country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX20_11" data-id="EX20_11">I, Yahweh, created the sky, the earth, the ocean, and everything that is in them in six days.

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX20_18" data-id="EX20_18">When the people heard the thunder and saw the lightning, and when they heard the sound of the trumpet and saw the smoke on the mountain, they were afraid and trembled. They stood at a distance</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX20_19" data-id="EX20_19">and said to Moses, "If you speak to us, we will listen. But do not let God speak anymore to us. We are afraid that if he speaks anymore to us, we will die."</span>

Sacrifice on it your burnt offerings, your offerings to promise friendship with me, and also your sheep and oxen. Worship me in any place that I choose for you to honor me; if you do that, I will come to you and bless you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX20_25" data-id="EX20_25">If you make for me an altar from stones, do not make it from stones that you have cut to make them look nice because you will make the altar unsuitable for worshiping me if you use tools to cut the stones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX20_26" data-id="EX20_26">Do not make an altar that has steps in front of it because if you do that, God could see your naked body as you go up the steps.'"</span>
