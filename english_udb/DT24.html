<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT24_1" data-id="DT24_1">Suppose a man marries a woman and later decides that he does not want her because there is something offensive, and he sends her away from his house. And suppose he writes a paper in which he says that he is divorcing her, and he gives the paper to her and sends her away from his house</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT24_2" data-id="DT24_2">Then suppose that she goes away. She is allowed to marry another man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT24_3" data-id="DT24_3">Suppose that that man later also decides that he does not like her, and that he also writes a paper in which he says that he is divorcing her, and he sends her away from his house. Or, suppose that the second husband dies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT24_4" data-id="DT24_4">If either of those things happen, her first husband must not marry her again. He must consider that she has become unacceptable to Yahweh. Yahweh would consider it to be disgusting if he married her again. You must not sin by doing that in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.</span>

He must be exempt from such work for one year after being married. He should stay at home and make his wife happy for that year.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT24_6" data-id="DT24_6">Anyone who lends money to someone else is allowed to require that person to give him something to guarantee that he will pay back the money that he borrowed, but he must not take from him his millstone because that would be taking from the other person the millstone that his family needs to make flour for baking bread to stay alive.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT24_7" data-id="DT24_7">If someone kidnaps a fellow Israelite to make that person his slave or to sell him to become someone else's slave, you must execute the person who did that. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil from among you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT24_11" data-id="DT24_11">Stand outside his house, and the man to whom you are lending something will bring the cloak out to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT24_12" data-id="DT24_12">But if he is poor, do not keep that cloak overnight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT24_13" data-id="DT24_13">When the sun sets, take the cloak back to him, in order that he may wear it while he sleeps. If you do that, he will ask God to bless you, and Yahweh our God will be pleased with you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT24_14" data-id="DT24_14">Do not mistreat any servants whom you have hired who are poor and needy, whether they are Israelites or foreigners who are living in your town.</span>
