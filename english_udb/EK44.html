<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_1" data-id="EK44_1">Then the man brought me back to the outer entrance to the temple area, the one on the east side, but the gate was shut.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_2" data-id="EK44_2">Yahweh said to me, "This gate must remain shut. It must not be opened by anyone; no one will be permitted to enter it. It must remain shut because I, Yahweh, the God of Israel, made it to be special to me when I came in through it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_3" data-id="EK44_3">Only the ruler of Israel will be permitted to sit inside this entrance to eat food in my presence. He must enter and leave the temple area through this gate."</span>

<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_4" data-id="EK44_4">Then the man brought me through the north entrance to the front of the temple. I looked and saw that the glory of Yahweh filled his temple, and I prostrated myself on the ground.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_5" data-id="EK44_5">Yahweh said to me, "Son of man, look carefully, and listen carefully to everything that I tell you about all the regulations concerning the temple. Note carefully the temple entrance and all the exits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_6" data-id="EK44_6">Say this to the rebellious Israelite people: 'This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: You Israelite people, I will no longer endure the detestable things that you do!</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_7" data-id="EK44_7">In addition to all the other detestable things that you do, you brought into my temple foreign men who had not been circumcised and who knew nothing about how to honor me. By doing that, you caused my temple to be an unacceptable place to worship me, while you offered food and fat and blood, and you disobeyed my covenant with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_8" data-id="EK44_8">Instead of doing what I commanded you to do in regard to my holy things, you appointed foreigners to be in charge of my temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_9" data-id="EK44_9">But this is what I, Yahweh, have said: No foreigners, no men who are not circumcised, no godless people are permitted to enter my temple, not even foreigners who live among you Israelites permanently.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_11" data-id="EK44_11">I will permit them to work in my temple and to be in charge of the temple gates. They will be able to slaughter the animals that will be completely burned on the altar, and to burn other sacrifices for the people, and they will be able to help the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_12" data-id="EK44_12">But because they helped the people to worship idols and caused many of the people of Israel to sin by worshiping idols, I swear that I will punish them for their sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_13" data-id="EK44_13">They must not come near me to serve as priests. They must not come near any sacred things or the holy offerings. They will be ashamed of the things that they did, of which they are guilty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_14" data-id="EK44_14">But I will still put them in charge of the work in the temple, and allow them to do all the work that needs to be done there.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_23" data-id="EK44_23">They must teach the people the difference between things that are holy and things that are not, and teach them how to know what things are acceptable to me and what things are not.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_24" data-id="EK44_24">If there is a dispute between people, the priests are the ones who must serve as judges and decide matters according to my laws.
