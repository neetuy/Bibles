<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_1" data-id="CL1_1">I, Paul, write this to the dear fellow believers in the city of Colossae. This is from Paul, whom God chose to send to you as an apostle of the Messiah Jesus, and this letter is also from Timothy, our fellow believer joined to the Messiah. We are sending this letter to all of you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_2" data-id="CL1_2">We send this letter to those God has set apart for himself—those who are faithful believers who belong to the Messiah. We pray that God our Father will give you his kindness and peace.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_3" data-id="CL1_3">We often thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, while we are praying for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_4" data-id="CL1_4">We give God thanks because we have heard that you trust in the Messiah Jesus and that you love all those whom God has set apart for himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_5" data-id="CL1_5">You love our fellow believers because you confidently are waiting for the things God is reserving for you in heaven. You first heard about these things when you heard the true message, the good news about the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_6" data-id="CL1_6">Believers are proclaiming this good news that you heard in Colossae to everyone in the world. It is just as it has worked in you also, from the first day you heard it and understood how truly kind God is. The good news is like a field planted with crops that are growing and will give a very large harvest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_7" data-id="CL1_7">Epaphras taught you the good news. We love him because he serves the Messiah together with us and works for the Messiah faithfully in our place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_8" data-id="CL1_8">He told us that you love all God's people because God's Spirit has empowered you to love God and others.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_9" data-id="CL1_9">Since the time we heard about how you love, we have always been praying for you. We ask God to show you everything he wants you to do, and to make you wise so that you will understand what God's Spirit is teaching you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_10" data-id="CL1_10">We pray that you will live in a way that will help others honor the Lord also, so that he will approve of you. We pray that you will grow to understand God more and do every good thing that he tells you to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_11" data-id="CL1_11">We pray that God will strengthen you with all his mighty power, so that you will patiently endure every difficulty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_12" data-id="CL1_12">We pray that you will be rejoicing and thanking God our Father, because he has declared you worthy to be with the others whom he has set apart for himself; this is so he can give you all the things that he is keeping for you when you are with him in the light of his presence.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_13" data-id="CL1_13">God our Father has rescued us from the evil that controlled us; he has made his Son, whom he loves, to rule over us now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_14" data-id="CL1_14">By means of his Son he has set us free from that evil; that is, he has forgiven our sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_15" data-id="CL1_15">When we know the Son, we know what God is like, even though we cannot see him. The Son has first place over everything that he has created.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_16" data-id="CL1_16">For the Son created all things, as the Father desired him to do: Everything in the sky and everything on earth, everything that we can see and everything that we cannot see, such as angelic beings of all kinds and powers and authorities, all things exist because the Son created them because the Father wanted him to. And they exist for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_17" data-id="CL1_17">The Son himself existed before anything else, and he holds everything together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_18" data-id="CL1_18">He rules all believers—the church—like a person's head rules his body. He rules over the church because he started it. He was the first person to come back to life with a perfect body. So he is greater than every thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_19" data-id="CL1_19">God the Father was pleased to make everything he is to live in the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_20" data-id="CL1_20">It also pleased God to bring everything back to himself in peace through Jesus. God offered peace to all people and all things everywhere on earth and in heaven. He did this by causing the Son to die on the cross as a sacrifice, shedding his blood as he died.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_21" data-id="CL1_21">Before you believed in the Messiah, God considered you his enemies, and you were unfriendly to God because you thought evil thoughts and because you did evil deeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_22" data-id="CL1_22">But now God has offered peace between yourselves and himself and has made you his friends. He did this when Jesus gave up his body and life for us by dying. This made it possible for us to belong to God; he finds nothing wrong in us now, nothing to blame us for.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_23" data-id="CL1_23">But you must continue to trust the Messiah completely; then you will be like a house that they built on solid rock. Do not for any reason stop believing in what God has promised to do for you in the good news that people all over the world have heard. This is the same good news that I, Paul, am serving God by proclaiming to people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_24" data-id="CL1_24">Now I rejoice that I am suffering for your benefit. Yes, in order to help the church, which is like the Messiah's body, I suffer things that must still happen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_25" data-id="CL1_25">God made me his servant and gave to me special work to do, which is to proclaim the full message of God to non-Jewish people like you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_26" data-id="CL1_26">From ancient times, for generations, God did not tell this good news, but now he has revealed this mystery to those whom he has set apart for himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_27" data-id="CL1_27">It is to these people—Jews and non-Jews like yourselves just as much—that God planned to tell this wonderful secret. It is this: the Messiah will live in you and make you confidently expect to share in God's glory!</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_28" data-id="CL1_28">We are wisely warning and teaching every person about the Messiah so that we might bring into God's presence each one as knowing God completely, joined to the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_29" data-id="CL1_29">It is to do this that I work my hardest, because the Messiah is giving me strength.</span>
