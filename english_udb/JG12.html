<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG12_5" data-id="JG12_5">The Gileadites captured the low places in the Jordan River where people could cross over the river and go to the territory of Ephraim. If someone from the tribe of Ephraim came to the ford to try to escape, he would say, "Allow me to cross the river." Then the men of Gilead would ask him, "Are you from the tribe of Ephraim?" If he said "No,"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG12_6" data-id="JG12_6">they would say to him, "Say the word 'Shibboleth.'" The men of Ephraim could not pronounce that word correctly. So if the person from the tribe of Ephraim said "Sibboleth," they would know that he was lying and that he was really from the tribe of Ephraim, and they would kill him there at the ford.</span>
