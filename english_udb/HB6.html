<span class="v-num v-1-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">1-3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_1-3" data-id="HB6_1-3">So, we must not keep discussing what we first learned about the Messiah, things that all believers must learn at first. Some of these things are how to stop doing sinful deeds, those that lead to death, and how to start trusting in God. There are also important things we teach: various kinds of baptism, why we often pray while putting our hands on each other; and also about how God will raise us all from the dead and judge everyone in a way that will last forever. Indeed, we will discuss these things again later, if God gives us the chance to do it. But now we must discuss things that are harder to understand; these are things that will help us to trust in the Messiah in all times, no matter what happens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_4" data-id="HB6_4">I will explain why it is important to do this. Some people have at one time understood the message about the Messiah. They learned what it was like for God to forgive them and for the Messiah to love them, and they received gifts from the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_5" data-id="HB6_5">They found for themselves that God's message is good, and they learned how God will work powerfully in the future.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_6" data-id="HB6_6">But now, if these people reject the Messiah, no one will be able to persuade them to stop sinning and to trust in him again! That is because it is as though these people have nailed the Son of God to his cross again! They are causing people to despise the Messiah in front of others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_7" data-id="HB6_7">Think about this: God has blessed land on which rain has frequently fallen and on which plants grow for the farmers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_8" data-id="HB6_8">But what will happen to believers who do not obey God is like what happens to land on which only thorns and thistles grow. Such land is worthless. It has become land that the farmer will curse and whose plants he will burn away.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_9" data-id="HB6_9">You can see that I am warning you, dear friends, not to reject the Messiah. At the same time, I am certain that you are doing better than that. You are doing the things that are in conformity with the fact that God is saving you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_10" data-id="HB6_10">Since God always acts justly, he will not overlook all you have done for him; he will not overlook how you have loved and helped your fellow believers, and how you are still helping them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_11" data-id="HB6_11">We greatly desire that each of you continue to show the same effort you are showing now, so that to the very end of your lives, you will be sure you will receive all that God promised to give you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_12" data-id="HB6_12">I do not want you to be lazy. Instead, I want you to do what other believers have done, those who are receiving what God promised them, because they trusted in him and were patient.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_13" data-id="HB6_13">When God promised to do great things for Abraham, there was no one greater than himself whom he could ask to force himself to do those things. So he asked himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_14" data-id="HB6_14">Then he said to Abraham, "I will certainly bless you and I will certainly greatly increase the number of your descendants."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_15" data-id="HB6_15">So after Abraham patiently waited for God to do what he promised, God did for him what he had promised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_16" data-id="HB6_16">Keep in mind that when people promise something, they ask a more important person to punish them if they do not do what they promise. This is how they often settle disputes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_17" data-id="HB6_17">So when God wanted to demonstrate very clearly to us who would receive what he had promised that he would not change what he had planned to do, he said that he would declare himself guilty if he did not do what he promised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_18" data-id="HB6_18">He did that to strongly encourage us, because he has done two things that cannot change: He promised to help us, and he told us that he would declare himself guilty if he did not help us. Now, God cannot lie. That is why we have trusted in him, just as he has encouraged us to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_19" data-id="HB6_19">Yes, we confidently expect to receive what God has promised to do for us. It is as if we were a ship, whose anchor is holding us firmly in one place. The one we confidently expect to hold us is Jesus, because he has gone into God's very presence. This is why he is just like the high priests who go behind the curtain into the innermost part of the temple, where God is present.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_20" data-id="HB6_20">Jesus went into God's presence ahead of us to allow us to enter in that same place with God, too. Jesus has become a high priest forever, in the way that Melchizedek was a high priest.</span>
