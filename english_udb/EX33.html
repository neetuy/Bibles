<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_1" data-id="EX33_1">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Leave this place and go with the people whom you led out of Egypt. Go to the land that I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that I would give to their descendants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_2" data-id="EX33_2">I will send my angel ahead of you, and I will remove from that land the people of Canaan, Amor, Heth, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_3" data-id="EX33_3">You will go to a land that will be very good for raising livestock and growing crops. But I will not go with you myself because if I did that, I might annihilate you while you are traveling because you are very stubborn people."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_4" data-id="EX33_4">When the people heard these words, they were sad, and no one wore fancy clothing anymore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_5" data-id="EX33_5">Yahweh had said to Moses, "Tell the Israelite people, 'You are very stubborn. If I were to go with you for even a moment, I would kill you. Now take off your fine clothing to show that you are sorry for your sin. Then I will decide how I will punish you.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_6" data-id="EX33_6">After the Israelite people left Mount Sinai, they wore no more fancy clothing.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_7" data-id="EX33_7">As the Israelite people were traveling, whenever they stopped and set up their tents, Moses set up the sacred tent outside the camp, far from the camp. He called it "the tent of meeting." Everyone who wanted Yahweh to decide something for them would go out of the camp to the tent of meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_8" data-id="EX33_8">Whenever Moses went out to the tent of meeting, all the people would stand at their own tent entrances and watch him until he had walked into the tent of meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_9" data-id="EX33_9">Whenever Moses went into the tent of meeting, the tall cloud would come down and stay at the tent entrance, and then Yahweh would talk with Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_10" data-id="EX33_10">When the people saw the tall cloud at the entrance of the tent of meeting, they would all worship Yahweh at their own tent entrances.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_11" data-id="EX33_11">Yahweh would speak to Moses face to face like someone speaks to his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp. But his young helper, Joshua son of Nun, would stay in the tent of meeting.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_12" data-id="EX33_12">Moses said to Yahweh, "It is true that you have told me, 'Lead the people to the land that I will show you,' but you have not told me whom you will send with me! Nevertheless, you have said that you know me well and that you are pleased with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_13" data-id="EX33_13">So now, if you are truly pleased with me, I ask you, please tell me the things that you are going to do in order that I may know you better and continue to please you. Please remember that the Israelite people are the people whom you chose to belong to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_14" data-id="EX33_14">Yahweh replied, "I will go with you, and I will give you rest."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_15" data-id="EX33_15">Moses replied, "If you do not go with me, do not make us leave this place.</span>

If you go with us, it will show that we are different from all the other people on the earth."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX33_17" data-id="EX33_17">Yahweh replied to Moses, "I will do what you have asked because I know you well and I am pleased with you."</span>
