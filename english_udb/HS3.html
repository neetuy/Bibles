They will have no prince, no sacrifices or pillars set up for worship, ephods or idols in their houses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS3_5" data-id="HS3_5">After some time, the people of Israel will return to Yahweh; they will hope that he will receive them back. They will hope to have a descendant of David for their king again. In the later time, they will come to Yahweh to honor him and tremble before him because of his goodness to them.</span>
