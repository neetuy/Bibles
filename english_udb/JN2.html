<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_1" data-id="JN2_1">Three days later, there was a wedding in Cana, a city in Galilee, and Jesus' mother was there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_2" data-id="JN2_2">They also invited Jesus and his disciples to the wedding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_3" data-id="JN2_3">They served wine to those attending the wedding and they drank all the wine they had. Jesus' mother said to him, "They are out of wine."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_4" data-id="JN2_4">Jesus said to her, "Madam, what does that have to do with me? The chosen time to begin my most important work has not come yet."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_5" data-id="JN2_5">Jesus' mother turned and said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_6" data-id="JN2_6">There were six empty stone jars there. They held water so that the guests and servants could wash their hands and feet, and so that other Jewish rites of cleansing could be done. Each jar could hold 75 to 115 liters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_7" data-id="JN2_7">Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water!" So they filled the jars to the brim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_8" data-id="JN2_8">Then he told them, "Now, draw some water out of a jar and take it to the director of the feast." So the servants did that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_9" data-id="JN2_9">The director of the feast tasted the water, which had now become wine. He did not know where the wine had come from, although the servants knew. So he called the bridegroom to himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_10" data-id="JN2_10">"Everyone serves the best wine first, and later when the guests have drunk a lot and the best is gone, then they serve the cheap wine. But you have kept the best wine until now."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_11" data-id="JN2_11">That was the first miracle Jesus did, one that signified truth about Jesus. He did it in the village of Cana, in the region of Galilee. There he showed that he could do amazing things. So the disciples trusted in him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_12" data-id="JN2_12">After this Jesus and his mother and brothers, along with his disciples, went down to the city of Capernaum, and they stayed there a few days.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_13" data-id="JN2_13">Now it was almost time for the Jewish Passover Celebration. Jesus and his disciples went up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_14" data-id="JN2_14">There in the temple courtyard he saw men selling cattle, sheep, and pigeons. The animals were sold to those who were making their sacrifices at the temple. He also saw men sitting at tables selling temple money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_15" data-id="JN2_15">So Jesus made a whip from some leather cords and he used it to drive out the sheep and the cattle from the temple. He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and scattered their coins on the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_16" data-id="JN2_16">He commanded those who were selling pigeons, "Take these pigeons out of here! Do not turn my Father's house into a marketplace!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_17" data-id="JN2_17">This reminded his disciples about what someone had written in the scriptures long before, "I love your house so much, O God, that I will die for it."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_18" data-id="JN2_18">The Jewish leaders asked him, "What miracle can you do for us to prove you have permission from God to do what you are doing?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_19" data-id="JN2_19">Jesus replied to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will rebuild it again."</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_20" data-id="JN2_20">"Are you saying that you are you going to rebuild this entire temple is just three days?" they asked him. "It took forty-six years to build this temple."</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_21" data-id="JN2_21">However, the temple Jesus was speaking about was his own body, not the temple building.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_22" data-id="JN2_22">Later, after Jesus had died and God had raised him from the dead, his disciples remembered what he had said about the temple. They believed both what the scriptures said and what Jesus himself had said.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_23" data-id="JN2_23">When Jesus was in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival, many people trusted in him because they saw the miracles that signified truth about Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_24" data-id="JN2_24">Nevertheless, Jesus knew what people were like, and because he knew them so well, he did not trust them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_25" data-id="JN2_25">He did not need anyone to tell him how evil people were. He knew everything about them.</span>
