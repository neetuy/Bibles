<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_1" data-id="T14_1"> Now God's Spirit clearly tells us that in later times some people will stop believing the teaching that all of us believe. Instead, they will listen to evil spirits who deceive people, and to the false teachings that they receive from these evil spirits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_2" data-id="T14_2">These people lie and yet do not feel guilty, as if a hot iron had burned and ruined their minds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_3" data-id="T14_3">They will try to stop believers from marrying. They will tell them not to eat certain things, even though God has created these things so that believers who have come to know the true teaching can enjoy them while thanking God for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_4" data-id="T14_4"> I say this because everything that God has made is good. We should not refuse to eat certain kinds of food if we thank God for it when we eat it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_5" data-id="T14_5">For by praying to God and by believing his word we make it acceptable to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_6" data-id="T14_6">When you keep teaching these things to your fellow believers, you will be serving Jesus the Messiah well. You will become strong spiritually by obeying the true message that we all believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_7" data-id="T14_7">But do not listen to the godless, foolish stories that only old women tell. Instead, train yourself to honor God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_8" data-id="T14_8">For physical exercise helps you only a little, but if you honor God, you can be sure that this will help you with everything both as you live now on earth and as you live in the future with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_9" data-id="T14_9">What I have just written is something that you can rely on. It is worth believing completely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_10" data-id="T14_10">For this reason we work very hard, as hard as we can, because we confidently expect that God, who is alive, will do the things that he has promised. He is the Savior of all humanity, but especially the Savior of those who believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_11" data-id="T14_11">Command these things and teach these things.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_12" data-id="T14_12">Do not allow anyone to say that you are useless because you are young. Instead, show other believers how to live. Show them this by how you speak, by how you live, by how you love, by how you trust God, and by how you keep from committing evil deeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_13" data-id="T14_13">Until I come to you, see to it that you read God's word to the believers in public, and that you teach it to the believers and urge them to obey it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_14" data-id="T14_14">Be sure to use the gift that is in you, what God gave to you when the elders laid their hands on you and told what God revealed to them about you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_15" data-id="T14_15">Be sure to do all these things that I have told you to do! Concentrate on them in order that everyone may see that you are improving in how you do them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_16" data-id="T14_16">Control yourself very carefully and do everything that we teach. Keep doing these things, so that God will save both you and the people who listen to you.</span>
