<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_2" data-id="NU10_2">"Tell someone to make two trumpets by hammering each one from one lump of silver. Blow the trumpets to summon the people to come together and also to signal that they must move their tents to a new location.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_3" data-id="NU10_3">If both trumpets are blown, it means that everyone must gather together at the entrance of the sacred tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_4" data-id="NU10_4">If only one trumpet is blown, it means that only the twelve leaders of the tribes must gather together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_5" data-id="NU10_5">If the trumpets are blown loudly, the tribes that are to the east of the sacred tent should start to move.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_6" data-id="NU10_6">When the trumpets are blown loudly the second time, the tribes that are to the south should start to move. The loud blasts on the trumpet will signal that they should start to move.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_7" data-id="NU10_7">When you want only to gather the people together, blow the trumpets, but do not blow them as loudly.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_8" data-id="NU10_8">The priests who are descended from Aaron are the ones who should blow the trumpets. That is a regulation that will never be changed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_9" data-id="NU10_9">When you fight against enemies who attack you in your own land, tell the priests to blow the trumpets loudly. I, Yahweh, your God, will hear that, and I will rescue you from your enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_10" data-id="NU10_10">Also tell the priests to blow the trumpets when the people are happy, and at the festivals each year, and at the times when they celebrate the new moon each month. Tell them to blow the trumpets when the people bring offerings that will be completely burned, and when they bring offerings to restore fellowship with me. If they do that, it will help you to think about me. You must do that, because I am Yahweh your God."</span>

<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_12" data-id="NU10_12">So the Israelites moved from the wilderness of Sinai, and they continued traveling north until the cloud stopped in the wilderness of Paran.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_13" data-id="NU10_13">That was the first time they moved, obeying the instructions that Yahweh had given to Moses to tell them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_29" data-id="NU10_29">One day Moses said to his brother-in-law Hobab son of Reuel from the Midian people group, "We are on the way to the place that Yahweh promised to give to us.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_30" data-id="NU10_30">But Hobab replied, "No, I will not go with you. I want to return to my own land and to my own family."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_31" data-id="NU10_31">But Moses said, "Please do not leave us. You know the places where we can set up our tents in this desert, and you can guide us.</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_33" data-id="NU10_33">So Hobab agreed to go with them. The Israelites left Mount Sinai, which they called the Mountain of Yahweh, and they walked for three days. The men carrying the sacred chest went in front of the other people for those three days, and they kept looking for a place to set up their tents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU10_34" data-id="NU10_34">The cloud sent by Yahweh was over them every day.</span>
