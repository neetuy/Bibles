<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_4" data-id="LV17_4">If you slaughter it anywhere else as a sacrifice, whether in the camp or outside of it, you will be guilty of shedding its blood in an unacceptable place. If you do that, you will no longer be allowed to be with Yahweh's people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_5" data-id="LV17_5">Yahweh is telling you to do this so that you will no longer offer sacrifices in the open fields; instead, you must offer them to him in the proper manner: By taking them to the priest at the entrance to the area of the sacred tent, to be offerings to promise friendship with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_6" data-id="LV17_6">After the priest slaughters the animal, he must sprinkle some of its blood against the altar at the entrance to the sacred tent, and burn its fat for an aroma that is pleasing to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_7" data-id="LV17_7">You people must no longer give sacrifices to the images that resemble goats. You people must obey this command for all time."</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_9" data-id="LV17_9">but if he does not bring it to the entrance of the sacred tent area as be a sacrifice to me, that person will no longer be allowed to be with my people.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_11" data-id="LV17_11">That is because the life of every animal is in its blood. I have declared that it is blood that is to be offered on the altar, so that I will forgive people their sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_12" data-id="LV17_12">That is why I say that neither you Israelites, nor any foreigner living among you, may consume any blood.</span>
