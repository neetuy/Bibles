<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_4" data-id="MT4_4">But Jesus said to him, "No! I will not do this, because God has said in the scriptures, 'For people to truly live, they must have more than food; they must listen to every word that God has spoken.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_5" data-id="MT4_5">Then the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem, the city that was especially for God. He set him on the highest part of the temple</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_6" data-id="MT4_6">and said to him, "If you are truly the Son of God, jump down to the ground. You will, of course, not be hurt, because God has said in the scriptures,</span>

<span class="v MT4_6" data-id="MT4_6"> 'God will command his angels to protect you.</div>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_7" data-id="MT4_7">But Jesus said, "No! I will not jump down, because God has also said in the scriptures, 'Do not try to make your God prove who he is.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_8" data-id="MT4_8">Then the devil took him on top of a very high mountain. There he showed him all the nations in the world and the magnificent things in those nations.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_13" data-id="MT4_13">Then he left Nazareth and went to the city of Capernaum in order to live there.

<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_17" data-id="MT4_17">At that time, while Jesus was in the city of Capernaum, he began to preach to the people, "The rule of God from heaven is near, and he will judge you when he rules. So stop sinning!"</span>

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_18" data-id="MT4_18">One day while Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two men, Simon, who was later called Peter, and Andrew, his younger brother. They were casting their fishing net into the water because they caught and sold fish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_19" data-id="MT4_19">Jesus said to them, "Come with me and I will teach you how to gather people to become my disciples. I will make your work fishing for people."</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_20" data-id="MT4_20">They immediately left the work that they were doing and went with him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_21" data-id="MT4_21">As the three of them walked on from there, Jesus saw two other men, James and John, the younger brother of James. They were in their boat with Zebedee, their father, mending their fishing nets. Jesus told them that they should leave their work and go with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_22" data-id="MT4_22">Immediately they also left their boat and their father and went with Jesus.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_23" data-id="MT4_23">Jesus led those four men throughout all of the district of Galilee. He was teaching the people in the synagogues. He was preaching the good news about how God is ruling. He was also healing all the people who were sick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_24" data-id="MT4_24">When people who lived in other parts of the district of Syria heard what he was doing, they brought to him people who suffered from illnesses, people who suffered from many kinds of diseases, people who suffered from severe pains, people who were controlled by demons, people who were epileptics, and people who were paralyzed. And Jesus healed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT4_25" data-id="MT4_25">Then large crowds started to go with him. They were people from Galilee, from the Ten Towns, from the city of Jerusalem, from other parts of the province of Judea, and from areas east of the Jordan River.</span>
