They are saying foolish things that they have only thought of themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_15" data-id="JR14_15">So this is what I say about those prophets who are predicting what will happen, saying that I told them those things: They are saying that we Israelites will not die from wars or famines, but I did not send those prophets.
