As a result, ten women will be able to bake all their bread in only one oven. When the bread is baked, each woman will divide it among the members of her family, but there will be very little for each one, and when they have eaten all of it, they will still be hungry.</span>

<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV26_42" data-id="LV26_42">I will keep in mind the covenant that I made with your ancestors Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and what I promised to them about the land of Canaan.</span>
