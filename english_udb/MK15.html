<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_1" data-id="MK15_1">Very early in the morning the chief priests met together with the rest of the Jewish council in order to decide how to accuse Jesus before the Roman governor. Their guards tied Jesus' hands again. They took him to the residence of Pilate, the governor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_2" data-id="MK15_2">Pilate asked Jesus, "Do you say that you are the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered him, "You yourself have said so."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_3" data-id="MK15_3">Then the chief priests claimed that Jesus had done many bad things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_4" data-id="MK15_4">So Pilate asked him again, "Do you have nothing to reply? Listen to how many bad things they are saying that you have done!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_5" data-id="MK15_5">But Jesus did not say anything more. The result was that Pilate was very much surprised.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_6" data-id="MK15_6">Now it was the governor's custom each year during the Passover Celebration to release one person who was in prison. He usually released any prisoner the people requested.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_7" data-id="MK15_7">At that time there was a man called Barabbas who was in prison with some other men. They had committed murder when they rebelled against the Roman government.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_8" data-id="MK15_8">A crowd approached Pilate and asked him to release someone, just as in the past.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_9" data-id="MK15_9">Pilate answered them, "Would you like me to release for you the man whom you people say is your king?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_10" data-id="MK15_10">He asked this because he realized what the chief priests were wanting to do. They were accusing Jesus because they were jealous of him because many people were becoming his disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_11" data-id="MK15_11">But the chief priests urged the crowd to request that Pilate release Barabbas for them instead of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_12" data-id="MK15_12">Pilate said to them again, "If I release Barabbas, what do you want me to do with your king?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_13" data-id="MK15_13">Then they shouted back, "Crucify him!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_14" data-id="MK15_14">Then Pilate said to them, "Why? What crime has he committed?" But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_15" data-id="MK15_15">So because Pilate wanted to please the crowd, he released Barabbas to them. Then his soldiers flogged Jesus; after that, Pilate told them to take him away and crucify him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_16" data-id="MK15_16">The soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard of the barracks. Then they summoned the whole cohort who were on duty there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_17" data-id="MK15_17">After the soldiers gathered together, they put a purple robe on Jesus. Then they placed on his head a crown that they had woven from thornbush branches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_18" data-id="MK15_18">Then they greeted him like they would greet a king, in order to ridicule him; they said, "Greetings, King of the Jews!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_19" data-id="MK15_19">They repeatedly struck his head with a reed and spat on him. They knelt down in front of him to pretend to honor him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_20" data-id="MK15_20">When they had finished mocking him, they pulled off the purple robe. They put his own clothes on him, and then they led him outside of the city in order to nail him to a cross.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_21" data-id="MK15_21">Now a man named Simon from Cyrene came along. He was the father of Alexander and Rufus, and he was passing by Jesus on his way to the city from somewhere else. The soldiers compelled Simon to carry the cross for Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_22" data-id="MK15_22">The soldiers brought them both to a place that they call Golgotha. That name means, "A place like a skull."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_23" data-id="MK15_23">Then they tried to give Jesus wine that was mixed with myrrh. But he refused to drink it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_24" data-id="MK15_24">Some of the soldiers took his clothes. Then they nailed him to a cross. Afterwards, they divided his clothes among themselves by gambling for them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_25" data-id="MK15_25">It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_26" data-id="MK15_26">They attached to the cross above Jesus' head a sign on which it had been written the reason why they were nailing him to the cross. It said, "The King of the Jews."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_27" data-id="MK15_27">They also nailed to crosses two men who were robbers. They nailed one to a cross at the right side of Jesus and one to a cross at his left side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_28" data-id="MK15_28"></span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_29" data-id="MK15_29">The people who were passing by insulted him by shaking their heads at him. They said, "Aha! You said that you would destroy the temple and then you would build it again within three days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_30" data-id="MK15_30">If you could do that, then rescue yourself by coming down from the cross!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_31" data-id="MK15_31">The chief priests, along with the men who taught the Jewish laws, also wanted to make fun of Jesus. So they said to each other, "He has saved others from trouble, but he cannot save himself!</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_32" data-id="MK15_32">He said, 'I am the Messiah. I am the King who rules the people of Israel.' If his words are true, he should come down now from the cross! Then we will believe him!" The two men who were crucified beside him also insulted him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_33" data-id="MK15_33">At noon the whole land became dark, and it stayed dark until three o'clock in the afternoon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_34" data-id="MK15_34">At three o'clock Jesus shouted loudly, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" That means, "My God, my God, why have you deserted me?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_35" data-id="MK15_35">When some of the people who were standing there heard the word 'Eloi', they misunderstood it and said, "Listen! He is calling for the prophet Elijah!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_36" data-id="MK15_36">One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine. He placed it on the tip of a reed, and then held it up to try to get Jesus to suck on it. He said, "Wait! Let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down from the cross!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_37" data-id="MK15_37">And then Jesus shouted loudly, stopped breathing, and died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_38" data-id="MK15_38">At that moment the curtain in the temple sanctuary split into two pieces from top to bottom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_39" data-id="MK15_39">The officer who supervised the soldiers who nailed Jesus to the cross was standing in front of Jesus. When he saw how Jesus had died, he exclaimed, "Truly, this man was the Son of God!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-40-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">40-41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_40-41" data-id="MK15_40-41">There were also some women there; they were watching these events from a distance. They had accompanied Jesus when he was in Galilee, and they had provided what he needed. They had come with him to Jerusalem. Among those women was Mary from Magdala. There was another Mary, who was the mother of the younger James and of Joses. There was also Salome.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-42-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">42-43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_42-43" data-id="MK15_42-43">When evening was near, a man named Joseph from Arimathea came there. He was a member of the Jewish council, one whom everyone respected. He was also one of those who had been waiting expectantly for when God would show himself as king. Evening was now approaching. It was the day before the Sabbath, a day the Jews called the day of preparation. So he went with courage to Pilate and asked him to permit him to take the body of Jesus down from the cross and bury it immediately.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_44" data-id="MK15_44">Pilate was surprised when he heard that Jesus was already dead. So he summoned the officer who was in charge of the soldiers who had crucified Jesus, and he asked him if Jesus had already died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_45" data-id="MK15_45">When the officer told Pilate that Jesus was dead, Pilate allowed Joseph to take away the body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_46" data-id="MK15_46">After Joseph had bought a linen cloth, he and others took Jesus' body down from the cross. They wrapped it in the linen cloth and laid it in a tomb that previously had been dug out of the rock cliff. Then they rolled a huge flat stone in front of the entrance to the tomb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_47" data-id="MK15_47">Mary from Magdala and Mary the mother of Joses were watching where Jesus' body was placed.</span>
