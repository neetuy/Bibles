<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_1" data-id="PP4_1">My fellow believers, I love you and I long for you. You give me joy; you will be the reason for which God will reward me. Dear friends, continue to believe firmly in the Lord, as I have described to you in this letter.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_2" data-id="PP4_2">I urge you, Euodia, and I urge you, Syntyche, to again have a peaceful relationship with each other, because you are both joined to the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_3" data-id="PP4_3">And I also urge you, my faithful partner, please help these women. They have faithfully proclaimed the good news and worked with me, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow laborers, whose names are in The Book of Life in which God has written the names of all those people who will live forever.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_4" data-id="PP4_4">Always rejoice for the Lord Jesus! I say again, rejoice!</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_5" data-id="PP4_5">All people must see that you are gentle because the Lord is near.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_6" data-id="PP4_6">Do not worry about anything. Instead, in every situation pray to God, tell him exactly what you need, and ask him to help you. And thank God for all he does for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_7" data-id="PP4_7">Then God's peace, which is much greater than we can understand, will be like a soldier that is guarding how you feel and how you think, as we are joined to the Messiah Jesus.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_8" data-id="PP4_8">Finally, my fellow believers, whatever is true, whatever is worthy for people to honor, whatever is right, whatever no one can find fault with, whatever is pleasing, whatever people should admire, whatever is good, whatever deserves people to praise it: These are the things that you should always be thinking about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_9" data-id="PP4_9">Those things that I have taught you and that you have received from me, those things that you have heard me say and that you have seen me do, those are the things that you yourselves should always do. Then God, who gives us his peace, will be with you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_10" data-id="PP4_10">I rejoice greatly and thank the Lord because now, after some time, you sent money to me, and so you have once again shown that you are concerned about me. Indeed, you were concerned about me all the time, but you had no opportunity to show it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_11" data-id="PP4_11">I am not saying this because I need certain things. In fact, I have learned to be content with whatever I have.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_12" data-id="PP4_12">I am able to be needy or to have plenty. I have learned how to be satisfied in all circumstances. I know the secret of how to be happy at all times.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_13" data-id="PP4_13">I am able to do everything because the Messiah makes me strong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_14" data-id="PP4_14">Nevertheless, you did the right thing to share with me in my hardship.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_15" data-id="PP4_15">My friends there at Philippi, you yourselves know that during the time I first proclaimed the good news to you, when I left there to go away from the province of Macedonia, no assembly of believers sent me funds or helped me in any way except you only!</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_16" data-id="PP4_16">Even when I was in the city of Thessalonica, you sent money more than once to supply what I needed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_17" data-id="PP4_17">I say this, not because I desire that you give me money now. Instead, I want to see you do even more things that God will praise you for.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_18" data-id="PP4_18">I have plenty of things now. I have so many things that you sent me through Epaphroditus. These things are like when priests burn an animal sacrifice to God and it smells good to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_19" data-id="PP4_19">God, whom I serve, will supply everything you need because you belong to Jesus the Messiah, who owns the splendor and wealth of heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_20" data-id="PP4_20">So people should praise God our Father, who will rule forever and ever in brilliant light! Amen!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_21" data-id="PP4_21">Greet for me all the believers. They all belong to God! The believers with me greet you, as well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_22" data-id="PP4_22">All of God's people here send their greetings to you. Especially the fellow believers who work in the palace of Caesar, the emperor, send their greetings to you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_23" data-id="PP4_23">My desire is that our Lord Jesus the Messiah will continue to act kindly toward you all. </span>
