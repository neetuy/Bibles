<div class="section chapter JG JG15 english_udb eng " dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="JG15" data-nextid="JG16" data-previd="JG14"><br>
<div class="c">15</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_1" data-id="JG15_1">During the time that they were harvesting the wheat, Samson took a young goat to Timnah as a present for his wife. He wanted to sleep with his wife, but her father would not let him go into her room.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_2" data-id="JG15_2">He said to Samson, "I really thought that you hated her. So I gave her to the man who was your best friend at the wedding, and she has married him. But look, her younger sister is more beautiful than she is. Take her instead."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_3" data-id="JG15_3">Samson replied, "No! And this time I have a right to get revenge on you Philistines!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_4" data-id="JG15_4">Then he went out into the fields and caught three hundred foxes. He tied their tails together, two by two. He fastened torches to each pair of tails.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_5" data-id="JG15_5">Then he lit the torches and let the foxes run through the fields of the Philistines. The fire from the torches burned all the grain to the ground, including the grain that had been cut and stacked in bundles. The fire also burned down their grapevines and their olive trees.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_6" data-id="JG15_6">The Philistines asked, "Who did this?" Someone told them, "Samson did it. He married a woman from Timnah, but then his father-in-law gave her to the man who was Samson's best friend at the wedding, and she married him." So the Philistines went to Timnah and got the woman and her father, and burned them to death.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_7" data-id="JG15_7">Samson found out about that and said to them, "Because you have done this, I will get revenge on you, and then I will be happy!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_8" data-id="JG15_8">So he attacked the Philistines furiously and killed many of them. Then he went to hide in a cave in the large rock at a place called Etam.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_9" data-id="JG15_9">The Philistines did not know where he was, so they went up to where the descendants of Judah lived, and they arranged themselves for battle at the town of Lehi.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_10" data-id="JG15_10">The men there asked the Philistines, "Why do you want to attack us?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JG15_10" data-id="JG15_10">The Philistines replied, "We have come to capture Samson. We have come to get revenge on him for what he did to us."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_11" data-id="JG15_11">Someone there knew where Samson was hiding. So three thousand men from Judah went down to get Samson at the cave in the rock where he was hiding. They said to Samson, "Do you not realize that the people of Philistia are ruling over us? Do you not realize what they will do to us?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JG15_11" data-id="JG15_11">Samson replied, "The only thing I did was that I got revenge on them for what they did to me."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_12" data-id="JG15_12">But the men from Judah said to him, "We have come to tie you up and put you in the hands of the Philistines."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JG15_12" data-id="JG15_12">Samson said, "All right, but promise me that you yourselves will not kill me!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_13" data-id="JG15_13">They replied, "We will just tie you up and take you to the Philistines. We will not kill you." So they tied him with two new ropes and led him away from the cave.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_14" data-id="JG15_14">When they arrived at Lehi, the Philistines came toward him, shouting triumphantly. But Yahweh's Spirit powerfully came on Samson. He snapped the ropes on his arms as easily as if they had been stalks of burned flax, and they fell off his wrists.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_15" data-id="JG15_15">Then he saw a donkey's jawbone lying on the ground. It was new, so it was hard. He picked it up and killed about a thousand Philistine men with it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_16" data-id="JG15_16">Then Samson sang:</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JG15_16" data-id="JG15_16">"With the jawbone of a donkey</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JG15_16" data-id="JG15_16">I have made them like a heap of dead donkeys.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JG15_16" data-id="JG15_16">With the jawbone of a donkey</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JG15_16" data-id="JG15_16">I have killed a thousand men."</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_17" data-id="JG15_17">When he finished, he threw the jawbone away, but later that place was called Ramath Lehi (or Jawbone Hill).</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_18" data-id="JG15_18">Then Samson was very thirsty, so he called out to Yahweh, "You have given me strength to win a great victory. So now must I die because of being thirsty, with the result that those heathen, uncircumcised Philistines will capture me?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_19" data-id="JG15_19">So God caused water to gush out of a depression in the ground at Lehi. Samson drank from it and soon felt strong again. He named that place En Hakkore (or "The spring of the one who called out"). That spring can still be found at Lehi, even today.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_20" data-id="JG15_20">Samson was the leader and judge over Israel for twenty years, but during that time the Philistines were in control of the entire land.</span>
