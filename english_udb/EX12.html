<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_1" data-id="EX12_1">Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses in Egypt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_2" data-id="EX12_2">"From now on, this month will be the first month of the year for you Israelites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_3" data-id="EX12_3">Tell all the Israelite people that in each family, the man who heads the family must take a lamb or a young goat for his household.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_4" data-id="EX12_4">If there are not enough people in his family to eat a whole cooked lamb, then his family and the family that lives next door may share one animal. Decide how many lambs you need according to the number of people in each family and according to how much each person can eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_5" data-id="EX12_5">The lambs or goats that you choose must be males, one year olds, and they must not have any defects.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_6" data-id="EX12_6">You must take special care of these animals until the fourteenth day of the month. On that day, all the Israelite people must kill the lambs or goats in the evening.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_7" data-id="EX12_7">Then they must take some of the blood from the lambs or goats, and they must smear it on the two doorposts and on the tops of the doorframes of the houses in which they will eat the meat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_8" data-id="EX12_8">They must roast the animals immediately and eat the meat that night. They must eat it with bitter herbs and with bread that is baked without yeast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_9" data-id="EX12_9">You must not eat any of the meat raw, and you must not boil the meat. You must roast it whole without cutting off the head or the legs or without removing the internal parts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_10" data-id="EX12_10">You must eat all the meat that evening; do not let any of the meat remain to be eaten the next morning. If any of the meat is left the next morning, you must burn it all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_11" data-id="EX12_11">When you eat it, you must be dressed ready to travel. You must have your sandals on your feet and your walking staff in your hands. You must eat it hurriedly. It will be a festival called Passover to honor me, Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_12" data-id="EX12_12">On that night I will go through all the land of Egypt, and I will kill all the oldest males in Egypt, both humans and animals. By doing this, I will punish all the gods in Egypt. It is I, Yahweh God, who am speaking to you!</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_13" data-id="EX12_13">The blood that you smear on the doorways will be a mark to show me the houses in which you Israelites live. When I see the blood, I will pass over those houses, and I will not harm the people who live there when I come to punish the Egyptians.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_14" data-id="EX12_14">Each year, you must celebrate this festival on this day to remember what I, Yahweh, have done for you. In all the generations to come, each year you must celebrate this festival. It must continue forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_15" data-id="EX12_15">For seven days you must eat bread that has no yeast in it. On the first day of that week, you must get rid of all the yeast that is in your houses. During those seven days, if anyone eats bread that is baked with yeast in it, you must drive that person out from your people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_16" data-id="EX12_16">On the first day of that week, you must have a holy meeting. You must do the same thing on the seventh day. People must not work on those two days. The only work they may do is to prepare food for you to eat.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_17" data-id="EX12_17">Every year you must keep celebrating this Festival of Unleavened Bread because it will remind you that it was on this day that I brought your tribes out of the land of Egypt. So every year, in all the generations to come, you must celebrate this day as a festival. It must continue forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_18" data-id="EX12_18">In the first month of the year, on the fourteenth day of that month, the only bread you may eat is bread that has no yeast in it. You must keep doing that each day until the twenty-first day of that month.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_19" data-id="EX12_19">For those seven days you must not have any yeast in your house. During that time, if anyone, either an Israelite or a foreigner, eats bread made with yeast, that person will no longer be an Israelite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_20" data-id="EX12_20">In your houses, do not eat anything that has yeast in it during those seven days."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_21" data-id="EX12_21">Then Moses summoned all the leaders of the Israelite people. He said to them, "Each family should select a lamb and kill it, in order that you may eat it to celebrate the festival that will be called 'Passover.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_22" data-id="EX12_22">Let the lamb's blood drain into a bowl. Get a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood. Then wipe some of the blood on the top of the doorframe and on the doorposts of your houses. The people in each house must stay inside the house until the next morning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_23" data-id="EX12_23">When Yahweh goes through Egypt to kill the oldest male in each Egyptian family, he will see the blood on your doorframes, and he will pass over those houses. He will not allow the angel who causes people to die to enter your houses and kill your oldest sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_24" data-id="EX12_24">You and your descendants must celebrate this ritual forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_25" data-id="EX12_25">When you arrive in the land that Yahweh will give to you as he promised, you must keep celebrating this ritual every year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_26" data-id="EX12_26">When your children ask you, 'What does this ritual mean?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_27" data-id="EX12_27">you must tell them, 'This ritual is to remember how your ancestors sacrificed lambs on the night that Yahweh's angel passed over the houses of the Israelite people when they were in Egypt. He killed the oldest males in all the Egyptian houses, but he did not kill the sons in our houses." After Moses told them this, the people all bowed their heads and worshiped Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_28" data-id="EX12_28">Then the Israelite people did exactly what Yahweh told Aaron and Moses to tell them to do.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_29" data-id="EX12_29">At midnight Yahweh killed all the oldest sons of the Egyptian people, all over Egypt. This included the king's oldest son, the oldest sons of the prisoners in the dungeons, and the oldest sons of everyone else. He also killed the oldest males of all the Egyptians' livestock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_30" data-id="EX12_30">That night the king, all his officials, and all the rest of the Egyptian people awoke and discovered what had happened. They wailed loudly all over Egypt because in every house someone's son had died.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_31" data-id="EX12_31">That night the king called Aaron and Moses and said, "Get up, you and all the other Israelite people, and leave my country now! Go and worship Yahweh, as you requested!</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_32" data-id="EX12_32">Take your flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle, and leave! And ask Yahweh to bless me, also!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_33" data-id="EX12_33">The Egyptians asked the Israelite people to leave their country quickly. They said, "If you do not do that, we will all die!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_34" data-id="EX12_34">So the Israelite people prepared to leave at once. They took the bowls in which they mixed the dough to make bread and the dough that was in the bowls without any yeast in it, and they wrapped the bowls in their cloaks. They put the bowls on their shoulders and left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_35" data-id="EX12_35">Then the Israelite people did as Moses told them. They went to their Egyptian neighbors and asked them for silver and gold jewelry and clothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_36" data-id="EX12_36">Yahweh caused the Egyptian people to greatly respect the Israelite people, so they gave them what they asked for. In that way, the Israelites carried away the wealth of the Egyptian people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_37" data-id="EX12_37">The Israelite people walked from the city of Rameses to the town of Succoth. There were about 600,000 men who went, in addition to the women and children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_38" data-id="EX12_38">Many other people who were not Israelites went along with them. There was also a large amount of livestock, including flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_39" data-id="EX12_39">On their way, they baked bread with the dough that they carried with them when they had been told to leave Egypt. The dough did not have yeast in it because they were told to leave Egypt so quickly that they did not have enough time to get food ready to take with them or enough time to mix yeast in the dough.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_40" data-id="EX12_40">The Israelite people had lived in Egypt for 430 years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_41" data-id="EX12_41">On the day that those 430 years ended, on that very day, all the tribes of Yahweh's people left Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_42" data-id="EX12_42">It was a night when the Israelites stayed awake as Yahweh brought them out of Egypt. So this same night every year is a night that is dedicated to Yahweh, a night when the Israelite people in every generation remember how Yahweh kept their ancestors safe.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_43" data-id="EX12_43">Then Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "These are my instructions about the Passover ritual: Do not let foreigners eat the Passover meal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_44" data-id="EX12_44">But any male slaves that you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_45" data-id="EX12_45">Do not let people who are living among you that are not Israelites, or servants whom you pay money to and who stay only for a while, eat the Passover meal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_46" data-id="EX12_46">Each family must eat the Passover meal inside its own house. Do not take any of the food outside the house. Do not break the bones of the lamb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_47" data-id="EX12_47">All the Israelite people must celebrate this festival.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_48" data-id="EX12_48">When someone from another country comes to live with you and wants to celebrate the Passover festival, circumcise all the males in his household. Then he can eat the Passover meal, and you should treat that man as though he had been born an Israelite. But do not allow men who have not been circumcised to eat the Passover meal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_49" data-id="EX12_49">These rules apply to people who were born as Israelites and to foreigners who come and live among you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_50" data-id="EX12_50">All the Israelite people obeyed Moses and Aaron and did what Yahweh had commanded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX12_51" data-id="EX12_51">On that very day, Yahweh brought all the tribes of the Israelite people out of Egypt.</span>
