<span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">Remember that God is very different from you and he is in heaven.</div>

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_5" data-id="EC5_5">It is better to not promise anything than to promise to do something and then not do it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_6" data-id="EC5_6">Do not let the things that you promise to do cause you to sin by not doing them. And if you promise God that you will do something but then do not do it, do not say to God's priest that it was a mistake for you to promise to do that. If you do that, God can destroy everything you have worked to accomplish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_7" data-id="EC5_7">Promising to do something and not doing it is like having a useless dream. Instead, honor God by doing what you promised him that you would do.</span>
