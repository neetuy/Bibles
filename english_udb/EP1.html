<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_1" data-id="EP1_1">I, Paul, write this letter to my dear fellow believers whom God has set apart for himself, and who are loyal to the Messiah Jesus—I am writing to the fellow believers who are living in the city of Ephesus. I am Paul, whom God chose and whom God sent to you as an apostle of the Messiah Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_2" data-id="EP1_2">I pray that God our Father and Jesus the Messiah our Lord will give you his kindness and peace.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_3" data-id="EP1_3">Praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus the Messiah! He has caused us great joy through every kind of heavenly spiritual blessing that the Messiah gives to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_4" data-id="EP1_4">Before God created the world he chose us to be his people through the Messiah, who set us apart for God to live blamelessly in his sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_5" data-id="EP1_5">Because he loves us, God planned long ago to adopt us as his own children because of what Jesus the Messiah has done. He planned to adopt us because it pleased him to have us as his children, so he did what he wanted to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_6" data-id="EP1_6">Because of this we now praise God for his amazing kindness given to us by his Son whom he loves, kindness that we did not deserve.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_7" data-id="EP1_7">Jesus has freed us as if he purchased us out of a slave market. He freed us by his death; that is, God has forgiven us of our sins, because he has been very, very kind to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_8" data-id="EP1_8">He has been very kind to us, and he has given us every kind of wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_9" data-id="EP1_9">God has now explained the secret of his plan. He has helped us to know the great work of the Messiah that he had planned. He did that because he chose to do it in that way, and he showed us what the Messiah would do for us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_10" data-id="EP1_10">God planned that at the time that he appointed he would unite all things in heaven and all things on earth, and the Messiah would be the one who will rule them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_11" data-id="EP1_11">Long ago God chose to unite us to the Messiah. He planned to do this, and he always does exactly what he wishes to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_12" data-id="EP1_12">God did that so that we who believe in the Messiah would live to give praise to God's glory. We were the first ones to trust in the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_13" data-id="EP1_13">It was in the Messiah that you also, after you had heard the word of truth, the good news of your salvation—it was in him that you also have believed and were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_14" data-id="EP1_14">The Holy Spirit is proof that we will receive all that God has promised. All this is great reason to praise him!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_15" data-id="EP1_15">Because God has done so much for you, and because I heard how you trust in the Lord Jesus and love all whom God has chosen for himself,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_16" data-id="EP1_16">I have not stopped thanking God for you and praying for you often.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_17" data-id="EP1_17">I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, the Father who lives in shining light, may help you think wisely and understand everything about what he reveals to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_18" data-id="EP1_18">I pray that God may teach you about what he wants to do for us, and why we know he is speaking the truth. I pray that we may know how great are the things he promises to give to us and to everyone whom he will choose to belong to himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_19" data-id="EP1_19">And I pray that you will know how very powerfully God acts for us who are trusting in the Messiah. He works powerfully for us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_20" data-id="EP1_20">just like he acted powerfully for the Messiah when he caused the Messiah to become alive again after he died, and raised him to the place of highest honor in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_21" data-id="EP1_21">In that place, the Messiah rules as supreme over every powerful spirit on every level of authority and over every name that exists. Jesus is much higher than any other being, not only now, but forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_22" data-id="EP1_22">God has put all beings under the rule of the Messiah, as if they were all under his feet. And God has appointed the Messiah as the ruler over everything among all believers everywhere.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_23" data-id="EP1_23">It is as if all believers together were the Messiah's own body. He fills all believers everywhere with his power, just as he fills all the universe with his power.</span>
