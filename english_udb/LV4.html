<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_1" data-id="LV4_1">Then Yahweh told Moses</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_2" data-id="LV4_2">to say this to the Israelite people, "This is what anyone must do if he sins without intending to sin, that is, if he does something that breaks any of Yahweh's commands.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_3" data-id="LV4_3">If the high priest sins and that causes all the people to be guilty, he must bring to Yahweh a young bull that has no defects. That will be an offering for the sin that he has committed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_4" data-id="LV4_4">He must bring the bull to the entrance to the sacred tent. He must lay his hands on its head. Then he must slaughter it in front of Yahweh and catch some of the blood in a bowl.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_5" data-id="LV4_5">Then the priest must take some of that blood into the sacred tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_6" data-id="LV4_6">He must dip one of his fingers into the blood and sprinkle it seven times in the presence of Yahweh, in front of the curtain that separates the holy place from the very holy place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_7" data-id="LV4_7">Then he must put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the altar where fragrant incense is burned in the sacred tent in the presence of Yahweh. The remaining part of the bull's blood that is still in the bowl, he must pour out at the base of the altar, where sacrifices are burned, at the entrance to the sacred tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_8" data-id="LV4_8">From that offering the high priest must separate these things from the bull that is to be burned: The fat that covers the inner parts of the bull or which is attached to them—</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_9" data-id="LV4_9">the kidneys and the fat that is attached to them near the lower back muscle, and the fat that covers the liver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_10" data-id="LV4_10">Then the high priest must completely burn those things on the altar. That will be just like when the fat is removed from an animal that is sacrificed to promised friendship with Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_11" data-id="LV4_11">But all the other parts of the animal—its skin and all its other meat, its head and its legs, its inner parts and the intestines,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_12" data-id="LV4_12">he must take outside the camp and throw them in a place that is made acceptable to Yahweh, where the ashes are thrown, and he must burn them in a fire on the pile of ashes.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV4_21" data-id="LV4_21">Then the priest must take the other parts of the bull outside the camp and burn them, like he does when he himself has sinned. That will be the offering for the sin that all the people have committed, and they will be forgiven.</span>
