This work of building the temple is great, because this glorious building will not be to honor people, but to honor Yahweh our God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R129_2" data-id="R129_2">From all the things that I possess, I have provided what will be needed to build the temple of my Godâ€”gold for the things to be made of gold, silver for the things to be made of silver, bronze for the things to be made of bronze, iron for the things to be made of iron, wood for the things to be made of wood, and large amounts of onyx and turquoise and other valuable stones of various colors, and marble and all kinds of valuable stones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R129_3" data-id="R129_3">In addition to all these things that I have given for the temple, I am giving my own treasures of gold and silver, because I very earnestly desire that this holy temple for my God be built.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R129_4" data-id="R129_4">I am giving about 100 metric tons of gold from Ophir and 230 metric tons of refined silver to cover the walls of the buildings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R129_5" data-id="R129_5">for making the other items of gold and silver, and for the other work to be done by the craftsmen. So now, I ask you, who is willing to show by contributing other gifts for the building of the temple that he has dedicated himself to Yahweh?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R129_6" data-id="R129_6">Then the leaders of the families, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of one thousand soldiers and the commanders of one hundred soldiers, and the officials who supervised the work that the king wanted done, gave gifts willingly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R129_7" data-id="R129_7">For the work at the temple they gave 165 metric tons and eighty-four kilograms of gold, 330 metric tons of silver, 600 metric tons of bronze, and 3,300 metric tons of iron.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R129_8" data-id="R129_8">Any people who owned valuable stones gave them to be put in the storeroom of the temple. Jehiel, a descendant of Gershon, was appointed to be in charge of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R129_9" data-id="R129_9">The people were happy to see that their leaders wanted to give those things; they were happy and enthusiastic to give those things to Yahweh. And King David also was very happy.</span>
