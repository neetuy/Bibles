<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_1" data-id="JR1_1">This is the message of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, who wrote this. He was a priest, from the town of Anathoth in the area where the tribe of Benjamin lives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_2" data-id="JR1_2">Yahweh started to give him these messages when Josiah had been ruling Judah for almost thirteen years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_3" data-id="JR1_3">Yahweh continued to give him messages when Josiah's son Jehoiakim was the king, and he continued to do that until Zedekiah had been the king of Judah for almost eleven years. It was in the fifth month of that year that the people of Jerusalem were exiled to Babylonia.</span>
</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_4" data-id="JR1_4">One day Yahweh gave me this message,</span>

<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_5" data-id="JR1_5">"I knew you before I finished forming you in your mother's womb.</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR1_5" data-id="JR1_5">I set you apart for my honor before you were born,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR1_5" data-id="JR1_5">and I appointed you to be my prophet for all the nations."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_6" data-id="JR1_6">I replied, "O, Yahweh my God, do you not see that I am not qualified to speak for you? I am very young!"</span>
</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_7" data-id="JR1_7">Yahweh replied, "Do not say that you are too young, because you must go to everyone to whom I will send you, and you must tell them everything that I tell you to say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_8" data-id="JR1_8">And you must not be afraid of the people to whom you will speak, because I will protect you from being harmed by them. This will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it!"</span>
</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_9" data-id="JR1_9">Then it was as though Yahweh touched my mouth and said, "Listen to me! I have put my message into your mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_10" data-id="JR1_10">Today I am appointing you to warn nations and kingdoms.

<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_11" data-id="JR1_11">Then Yahweh showed something to me, and said, "Jeremiah, what do you see?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JR1_11" data-id="JR1_11">I replied, "I see a branch from an almond tree."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_12" data-id="JR1_12">Yahweh said, "That is correct. And because the word for 'almond' resembles the word for 'watching', it means that I am watching what will happen, and I will make certain that what I have said to you about destroying nations will happen."</span>

<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_13" data-id="JR1_13">Then Yahweh spoke to me again and said, "What do you see now?"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v JR1_13" data-id="JR1_13">I replied, "I see a pot full of boiling water. It is in the north, tipping toward me."</span>

</div>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_15" data-id="JR1_15">Listen to what I say:</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR1_15" data-id="JR1_15">I am summoning the armies of the kingdoms that are north of Judah to come to Jerusalem. \q1 Their kings will set up their thrones at the gates of this city to indicate that they are now the kings of Judah.</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR1_15" data-id="JR1_15">Their armies will attack and break down the walls of this city, and they will do the same thing to all the other towns in Judah.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_16" data-id="JR1_16">I will punish my people because of all the evil things that they have done;</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JR1_16" data-id="JR1_16">they have abandoned me and they offer offerings of worship to false gods.</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR1_16" data-id="JR1_16">They worship idols that they have made with their own hands!</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_17" data-id="JR1_17">So, get up and put on your clothes to get ready for action! Then go to the people of Judah and tell them everything that I tell you to say. Do not be afraid of them, because if you are afraid of them, I will punish you as an example right in front of them!</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_18" data-id="JR1_18">But listen! I will cause you to be strong, like a city that has strong walls around it. You will be as strong as an iron pillar or a bronze wall. Even the royal officials, the priests, and the general populace will not be able to defeat you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR1_19" data-id="JR1_19">They will oppose you, but they will not be able to defeat you, because I will be with you and will protect you. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it!"</span>
