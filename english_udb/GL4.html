<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_1" data-id="GL4_1">Now, I will further discuss children and heirs. An heir is a son who will later possess all that his father has. But as long as that heir is a child, he is like a slave whom others control.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_2" data-id="GL4_2">Until the day that his father has previously determined, other persons supervise the child and manage his property.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_3" data-id="GL4_3">Likewise, when we were like young children, we were under the evil rules that everyone in this world lives by. Those rules controlled us like masters control their slaves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_4" data-id="GL4_4">But when the time that God had determined arrived, he sent Jesus, his Son, into the world. Jesus was born to a human mother, and he had to obey the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_5" data-id="GL4_5">God sent Jesus to rescue us from the law controlling us. He did this to adopt us as his own children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_6" data-id="GL4_6">Because you are now God's sons, he sent the Spirit of his Son to live in each of us. It is his Spirit who enables us to call God, "Father, our dear Father!" This shows that we are God's sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_7" data-id="GL4_7">So, because of what God has done, no longer is each of you like a slave. Instead, each of you is a child of God. Since each of you is now God's child, God will also give you all that he has promised. God himself will do it!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_8" data-id="GL4_8">When you did not know God, you worshiped gods that really did not really exist. You were their slaves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_9" data-id="GL4_9">But now you do know God as your God. Perhaps it would be better, however, to say that now God knows each of you. So why are you returning again to follow the weak and worthless evil rules of this world? You do not really want to become their slaves all over again, do you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_10" data-id="GL4_10">It actually seems that you do! You are once more obeying what others insist you should do on certain special days and at special times in certain months, seasons, and years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_11" data-id="GL4_11">I worry about you! I worked so hard for you, but it seems that it was all for nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_12" data-id="GL4_12">My fellow believers, I strongly urge you to become like me, because I do not let the law control me. I became like you non-Jews when I became free from the law, so you too should free yourselves from the gods. When I first went to you, you did not harm me at all, but now you are making me worry about you very much.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_13" data-id="GL4_13">You remember that the first time I told you the good news, I did it because I was sick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_14" data-id="GL4_14">Although you might have despised me because I was sick, you did not reject me. Instead, you welcomed me like you would welcome an angel that came from God. You welcomed me like you would welcome the Messiah Jesus himself!</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_15" data-id="GL4_15">But now you are no longer happy! I know for certain that you would have done anything to help me. You would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me, if that would have helped me!</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_16" data-id="GL4_16">That is why I have become so sad now. You seem to think that I have become your enemy because I have continued to tell the truth about the Messiah to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_17" data-id="GL4_17">Those who are insisting on obeying the Jewish laws are trying to get you to follow them, but they are not doing it for your good. They want to keep you away from me, because they want you to follow them, not me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_18" data-id="GL4_18">Well, it is good to insist on doing the right things; you should do this always, and not only when I am with you. But make sure it is the right people who are teaching you what to do!</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_19" data-id="GL4_19">You who are like my children, once again I am very worried about you, and I will continue to be worried until you become like the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_20" data-id="GL4_20">But I do wish that I could be with you now and that I might talk more gently with you, because right now I do not know what to do about you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_21" data-id="GL4_21">Let me try to explain this again. Some of you desire to obey all the law of God, but do you really pay attention to what the law says?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_22" data-id="GL4_22">In the law we read that Abraham became the father of two sons. His female slave, Hagar, bore one son, and his wife Sarah, who was not a slave, bore the other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_23" data-id="GL4_23">Ishmael, the son born by Hagar, the female slave, was conceived naturally. But Isaac, the son born by Sarah, who was not a slave, was conceived miraculously because God had promised Abraham that he would have a son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_24" data-id="GL4_24">Now these two women symbolize two covenants. God made the first covenant with the people of Israel at Mount Sinai. That covenant requires the Israelites to live like a slave to the law. So Hagar, the female slave, symbolizes this covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_25" data-id="GL4_25">So Hagar symbolizes Mount Sinai, in the land of Arabia. But Hagar also symbolizes the city of Jerusalem as it is today. This is because Jerusalem is like a slave mother: She and all her children—that is, her people—are like slaves, because they all must obey the law that God gave to Israel at Mount Sinai.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_26" data-id="GL4_26">But there is a new Jerusalem in heaven, and that city is like a mother of all us who believe in the Messiah, and that city is free!</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">That new Jerusalem will have many more people than the old Jerusalem. This is because the prophet Isaiah wrote,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">"You who live in Jerusalem, you must rejoice!</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">Now you have no children,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">like a woman who cannot have children!</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">But one day you will shout with joy</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">even though you have no children now.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">Like a woman who cannot give birth to children,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">and you feel deserted.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">You will have more children than</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">any woman with a husband could have borne."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_28" data-id="GL4_28">Now, my fellow believers, you have become children of God because you believed in what God promised to give to us. You are like Isaac, who was born because Abraham had believed in what God promised to give to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_29" data-id="GL4_29">But long ago Abraham's son Ishmael, who was born naturally, caused trouble for Abraham's son Isaac, who was born because the Holy Spirit made it happen. It is the same way now. The people who are slaves to God's law persecute those of us who trust in what the Messiah has promised to give us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_30" data-id="GL4_30">But these are the words in the scriptures: "The son of the woman who was not a slave will inherit what his father owns. The slave boy will inherit nothing. So send away from this place the female slave and her son!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_31" data-id="GL4_31">My fellow believers, we are not children who have a slave woman as our mother, but we are the children who are born from a woman who was free, and so are we are free too!</span>
