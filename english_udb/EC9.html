<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC9_11" data-id="EC9_11">and the people who have studied a lot are not always honored by others.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC9_11" data-id="EC9_11">We cannot always control what things will happen to us and where they will happen.</div>

<span class="v EC9_12" data-id="EC9_12">Fish are cruelly caught in a net,</div>

<span class="v EC9_12" data-id="EC9_12">and birds are caught in snares.</div>

<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC9_12" data-id="EC9_12">Similarly, people experience disasters</div>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_13" data-id="EC9_13">Once I saw here on this earth something that a wise man did that impressed me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_14" data-id="EC9_14">There was a small town, where only a few people lived. The army of a great king came to that town and surrounded it. They built dirt ramps up against the walls in order to climb up and attack the town.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_15" data-id="EC9_15">In that town there was someone who was poor but very wise. Because of what that person suggested, the town was saved, but people soon forgot about him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_16" data-id="EC9_16">So I realized that although being wise is better than being strong, if you are poor, no one will appreciate what you do, and people will soon forget what you said.</span>

<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_17" data-id="EC9_17">A wise man who speaks quietlyâ€”people hear him better</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC9_17" data-id="EC9_17">than they hear a king who is shouting to a foolish crowd.</div>

<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_18" data-id="EC9_18">Being wise is more useful</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC9_18" data-id="EC9_18">than having a lot of weapons;</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC9_18" data-id="EC9_18">however, if a person does just one foolish thing,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC9_18" data-id="EC9_18">he might ruin many good things that others have done.</div>
