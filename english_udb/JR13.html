<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_1" data-id="JR13_1">One day Yahweh said to me, "Go and buy a linen waistcloth. Put it on, but do not wash it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_2" data-id="JR13_2">So I bought a very nice waistcloth, which is what Yahweh told me to do, and I put it on.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_3" data-id="JR13_3">Then later Yahweh gave me another message.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_4" data-id="JR13_4">He said, "Go to the Euphrates River and hide your waistcloth in a crevice in the rocks."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_5" data-id="JR13_5">So I went to the river and did what Yahweh told me to do.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_6" data-id="JR13_6">A long time later, Yahweh said to me, "Go back to the river and get the waistcloth that I told you to hide there."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_7" data-id="JR13_7">So I went to the Euphrates River and dug out the waistcloth from the crevice in which I had hidden it. But it was ruined, and useless.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_8" data-id="JR13_8">Then Yahweh gave me this message:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_9" data-id="JR13_9">"What happened to your waistcloth shows that I will destroy the things that the people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah are very proud of.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_10" data-id="JR13_10">Those wicked people refuse to pay attention to what I say. They stubbornly do just what they desire to do; they worship other gods. Therefore, they will become completely useless, like your waistcloth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_11" data-id="JR13_11">Just like a waistcloth clings closely to a man's waist, I wanted the people of Israel and Judah to cling closely to me. I wanted them to be my people, people who would praise me and honor me. But they would not pay attention to me.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_12" data-id="JR13_12">So, tell this to them: 'Yahweh, the God whom you Israelite people worship, says that every leather wineskin should be filled with wine.' And when you tell that to them, they will reply, 'Of course we know that all wineskins should be filled with wine!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_13" data-id="JR13_13">And then you must tell them, 'No, that is not what Yahweh means. What he said means that he will cause this land to be filled with people who are drunk. That will include all of youâ€”the king who sits on the throne that King David previously sat on, the priests and the prophets, and even the common people of Jerusalem.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR13_14" data-id="JR13_14">He is saying, 'I will cause a drunken brawl among you. Even parents will brawl with their children. I will not pity you or act mercifully toward you at all; pitying you will not prevent me from getting rid of you.'"</span>
