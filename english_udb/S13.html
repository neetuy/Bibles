<div class="c">3</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_1" data-id="S13_1">While he was still a boy, Samuel was serving Yahweh while Eli supervised him. At that time there were very few messages that anyone received from Yahweh, and very few people saw visions that Yahweh gave them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_2" data-id="S13_2">By that time Eli's eyes were very weak; he was almost blind. One night he was sleeping in his room,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_3" data-id="S13_3">and Samuel was sleeping in the temple of Yahweh, where the sacred chest was kept. There was a lamp there that represented the presence of God, and it was still burning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_4" data-id="S13_4">Just then Yahweh called, "Samuel! Samuel!" Samuel replied, "I am here!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_5" data-id="S13_5">Then he got up and ran to Eli. He said to him, "I am here, because you called me!" But Eli replied, "No, I did not call you. Go back to your bed." So Samuel went and lay down again.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_6" data-id="S13_6">Then Yahweh called again, "Samuel!" So Samuel got up again and went to Eli and said, "I am here, because you called me!" But Eli said, "No, my son, I did not call you. Go back and lie down."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_7" data-id="S13_7">At that time Samuel had not yet known what it was like for Yahweh to speak to him, because Yahweh had not previously revealed anything to him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_8" data-id="S13_8">After Samuel lay down again, Yahweh called him a third time. So again Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "I am here, because you called me!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v S13_8" data-id="S13_8">Then Eli realized that it was Yahweh who was calling the boy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_9" data-id="S13_9">So he said to Samuel, "Go and lie down again. If someone calls you again, say 'Speak to me, Yahweh, because I am listening!'" So Samuel went and lay down again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_10" data-id="S13_10">Then Yahweh came and stood and called as he had done the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak to me, because I am listening!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_11" data-id="S13_11">Then Yahweh said to Samuel, "Listen carefully. I am about to do something here in Israel that will shock everyone who hears about it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_12" data-id="S13_12">When that happens, I will punish Eli and his family. I will do to them everything that I said that I would do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_13" data-id="S13_13">His sons have shown great disrespect for me by the disgraceful things they have done, and Eli did not keep them back from doing it. So I told him that I would punish his family forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_14" data-id="S13_14">I solemnly promised to Eli's family, 'You will never be able to avoid the consequences for your sin, even if you give me sacrifices or offerings.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_15" data-id="S13_15">Samuel lay down again until morning. Then he got up and opened the doors of the building as usual. He was afraid to tell Eli about the vision that Yahweh had given him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_16" data-id="S13_16">But Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son!" Samuel answered, "I am here!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_17" data-id="S13_17">Eli asked him, "What was it that Yahweh told you? Do not conceal it! I want God to punish you severely if you do not tell me everything that he said to you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_18" data-id="S13_18">So Samuel told him everything. He did not refuse to tell him anything. Then Eli said, "He is Yahweh. I am willing for him to do what he thinks is best."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_19" data-id="S13_19">As Samuel grew up, Yahweh helped him; he made everything that Samuel predicted to come true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_20" data-id="S13_20">So all the people of Israel, from the northern end of the country to the southern end, realized that Samuel was truly a prophet of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_21" data-id="S13_21">Yahweh continued to appear to Samuel in Shiloh and give messages to him.</span>
