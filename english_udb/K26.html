<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_1" data-id="K26_1">One day the association of prophets said to Elisha, "Look, this place where we meet together with you is very small.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_2" data-id="K26_2">Allow us to go to the Jordan River and cut down some trees to make logs to build a new meeting place." So Elisha said, "Very well, go."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_3" data-id="K26_3">One of them said to Elisha, "Please come with us." So Elisha replied, "Very well, I will go with you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_4" data-id="K26_4">So they went together. When they reached the Jordan River they cut down some trees.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_5" data-id="K26_5">But while one of them was cutting down a tree, suddenly the axe head separated from the handle and fell into the water. He cried out to Elisha, "O, Master, what shall I do? The axe is not mine. I borrowed it!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_6" data-id="K26_6">Elisha replied, "Where did it fall into the water?" After the man showed him the place, Elisha cut off a stick, threw it into the water, and the axe head rose to the water surface.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_7" data-id="K26_7">Elisha said, "Take it out of the water." So the man reached his hand down and picked up the axe head.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_8" data-id="K26_8">Whenever the king of Aram prepared to send his army to fight against Israel, he first consulted his officers, and then told them where they should set up their tents.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_9" data-id="K26_9">But each time Elisha would send a message to warn the king of Israel, telling him where the army of Aram was planning to attack them, saying, "Be sure that your army does not go near that place, because the army of Aram has set up their tents there."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_10" data-id="K26_10">So the king of Israel would send messengers to warn the people who lived in that place, and the people would remain on guard. That happened several times.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_11" data-id="K26_11">The king of Aram was very upset about this, so he summoned his army officers and said to them, "One of you is revealing our plans to the king of Israel. Which one of you is doing it?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_12" data-id="K26_12">One of his officers answered, "Your Majesty, it is not one of us. Elisha the prophet knows what we plan to do, and he tells the king of Israel everything. He even knows what you say in your own bedroom!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_13" data-id="K26_13">The king of Aram replied, "Go and find out where he is, and I will send some men there to capture him." Someone told him, "People say that he is in the city of Dothan, north of Samaria."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_14" data-id="K26_14">So the king sent a large group of soldiers to Dothan with horses and chariots. They arrived at night and surrounded the city.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_15" data-id="K26_15">Early the next morning, Elisha's servant got up and went outside the house. He saw the soldiers of Aram with their horses and chariots surrounding the town. So he went inside the house and reported it to Elisha and exclaimed, "Oh, sir! What are we going to do?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_16" data-id="K26_16">Elisha replied, "Do not be afraid! Those who are helping us are many more than those who are helping them!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_17" data-id="K26_17">Then he prayed, "Yahweh, I request that you open my servant's eyes in order that he can see what is out there!" So Yahweh enabled the servant to look out and see that surrounding the hill on which the town was built was a huge number of horses and chariots; they seemed to be made of fire!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_18" data-id="K26_18">When the army of Aram prepared to attack Elisha, he prayed again, saying, "Yahweh, cause all these soldiers to become blind!" Yahweh answered his prayer and caused them to be unable to see clearly.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_19" data-id="K26_19">Then Elisha went to them and said, "You are not on the right road. This is not the city that you are searching for. I will take you to the man whom you are searching for." But he led them to the city Samaria, the capital of Israel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_20" data-id="K26_20">As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha prayed again, saying, "Yahweh, now enable these soldiers to see correctly again!" So Yahweh enabled them to see correctly, and they were surprised to see that they were inside Samaria.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_21" data-id="K26_21">When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, "Sir, shall I tell my soldiers to kill them? Shall we kill all of them?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_22" data-id="K26_22">Elisha replied, "No, you must not kill them. If your army captured many of your enemies in a battle, you would certainly not kill them. Give these men something to eat and drink, and then allow them to return to their king."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_23" data-id="K26_23">So the king of Israel did that. He told his servants to provide a big feast for them. And when they had eaten and drunk plenty, he sent them away. They returned to the king of Aram and told him what had happened. So for a while after that, soldiers from Aram stopped raiding towns in Israel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_24" data-id="K26_24">But some time later, Ben Hadad the king of Aram , assembled his entire army, and they went to Samaria and surrounded the city for a long time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_25" data-id="K26_25">Because of that, after a while there was hardly any food left inside the city, so that eventually a donkey's head, which was usually worthless, cost eighty pieces of silver, and one cup of dove's dung cost five pieces of silver.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_26" data-id="K26_26">One day when the king of Israel was walking on top of the city wall, a woman cried out to him, "Your Majesty, help me!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_27" data-id="K26_27">He replied, "If Yahweh will not help you, I certainly cannot. I do not have any wheat or wine!</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_28" data-id="K26_28">What is your problem?" She replied, "Several days ago, that women over there said to me, 'Because we have nothing left to eat, let us kill your son today, in order that we can eat his flesh. Then tomorrow we can kill my son and eat his flesh.'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_29" data-id="K26_29">So we killed my son and cut his body up and boiled his flesh and ate it. The next day, I said to her, 'Now give your son to me, in order that we can kill him and cook his flesh and eat it.' But she has hidden her son."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_30" data-id="K26_30">When the king heard what the woman said, he tore his robe to show that he was very upset. The people who were standing close to the wall were able to see that the king was wearing rough cloth underneath his robe because he was very upset.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_31" data-id="K26_31">The king exclaimed, "I wish that God will strike me dead if I do not cut off the head of Elisha today, because he is the one who has caused these terrible things to happen to us!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_32" data-id="K26_32">So the king sent an officer to get Elisha.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v K26_32" data-id="K26_32">Before the officer arrived, Elisha was sitting in his house with some Israelite elders who were talking with him. Elisha said to them, "That murderer, the king of Israel, is sending someone here to kill me. Listen. When he arrives, shut the door and do not allow him to come in, because the king will be coming right behind that officer!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_33" data-id="K26_33">And while he was still speaking, the king and the officer arrived. The king said, "It is Yahweh who is allowing us to have all this trouble. I will no longer wait for him to help us."</span>
