<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_1" data-id="LK4_1">Then Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan River, and the Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_2" data-id="LK4_2">The Holy Spirit led him around in the wilderness for forty days. While he was there, the devil kept tempting him. During the entire time Jesus was in the wilderness he did not eat anything, so when the forty days were over, he was very hungry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_3" data-id="LK4_3">Then the devil said to Jesus, "If you really are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread for you to eat!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_4" data-id="LK4_4">Jesus replied, "No, I will not do that, because it is written in the scriptures, 'People need more than just food in order to live.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_5" data-id="LK4_5">Then the devil took Jesus up to the top of a high mountain and showed him in an instant all the nations in the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_6" data-id="LK4_6">Then he said to Jesus, "I will give you the right to rule all these nations and you will possess all their splendor and wealth. God has permitted me to control them all, and so I can do whatever I want to do with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_7" data-id="LK4_7">So if you worship me, I will let you rule them all!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_8" data-id="LK4_8">But Jesus replied, "No, I will not worship you, because it is written in the scriptures, 'You must only worship the Lord, your God. He is the only one you may serve!'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_9" data-id="LK4_9">Then the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem. He set him on the highest part of the temple and said to him, "If you really are the Son of God, jump down from here.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_10" data-id="LK4_10">You will not be hurt, because it is written in the scriptures,</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v LK4_10" data-id="LK4_10">'God will command his angels to protect you.'</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_11" data-id="LK4_11">And it also says,</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v LK4_11" data-id="LK4_11">'They will lift you up in their hands when you are falling, so that you will not get hurt. You will not even strike your foot on a stone.'"</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_12" data-id="LK4_12">But Jesus replied, "No, I will not do that, because it is written in the scriptures: 'Do not try to test the Lord your God'."</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_13" data-id="LK4_13">Then, after the devil had finished trying to tempt Jesus in many ways, he left him until a later time.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_14" data-id="LK4_14">After this, Jesus left the wilderness and returned to the district of Galilee. The Holy Spirit was empowering him. Throughout that region, people heard about Jesus and told others about him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_15" data-id="LK4_15">He taught people in their synagogues and they all spoke highly of him because of his teaching.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_16" data-id="LK4_16">Then Jesus went to Nazareth, the town where he grew up. On the Sabbath he went to the synagogue, as he usually did. He stood up to read aloud something from the scriptures.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_17" data-id="LK4_17">A synagogue attendant handed him a scroll containing the words that the prophet Isaiah had written long ago. Jesus unrolled the scroll and found the place where these words were written:</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v LK4_17" data-id="LK4_17">\v 18 "The Spirit of the Lord is in me.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v LK4_17" data-id="LK4_17">He has appointed me to declare God's good news to people who are poor.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v LK4_17" data-id="LK4_17">He has sent me here to proclaim that the captives will go free,</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v LK4_17" data-id="LK4_17">And will tell those who are blind that they will see again.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v LK4_17" data-id="LK4_17">I will free people who have been oppressed.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_19" data-id="LK4_19">He sent me here to declare that now is the time when the Lord will act favorably toward people."</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_20" data-id="LK4_20">Then he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. Everyone in the synagogue was looking intently at him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_21" data-id="LK4_21">He said to them, "Today this scripture passage was fulfilled as you heard it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_22" data-id="LK4_22">Everyone there heard what he said and marveled at him, and they were amazed at how well he spoke. But some of them said, "This man is only Joseph's son, right?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_23" data-id="LK4_23">He said to them, "Surely some of you will quote to me the proverb that says, 'Doctor, heal yourself!' You will say, 'Do here in your hometown the same kind of miracles that you did in Capernaum!'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_24" data-id="LK4_24">Then he said, "It is certainly true that the people in a prophet's own hometown do not accept his message.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_25" data-id="LK4_25">But think about this: There were many widows in Israel during the time when the prophet Elijah lived, when there was a great famine throughout the country because there had been no rain for three and half years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_26" data-id="LK4_26">But God did not send Elijah to help any of those Israelite widows. God sent him to the town of Zarephath near the city of Sidon, to help a widow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_27" data-id="LK4_27">There were also many Israelite lepers in Israel during the time when the prophet Elisha lived. But Elisha did not heal any of them. He healed only Naaman, a man from Syria."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_28" data-id="LK4_28">When all the people in the synagogue heard him say that, they were very angry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_29" data-id="LK4_29">So they all got up and shoved him out of the city. They took him to the top of the hill outside their city in order to throw him off the cliff and kill him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_30" data-id="LK4_30">But he simply walked through their midst and went away.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_31" data-id="LK4_31">One day he went down to Capernaum, a city in the district of Galilee. On the next Sabbath, he taught the people in the synagogue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_32" data-id="LK4_32">They were continually amazed at what he was teaching, because he spoke with confidence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_33" data-id="LK4_33">That day, there was a man in the synagogue who was controlled by an evil spirit. The man shouted very loudly,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_34" data-id="LK4_34">"Ha! Jesus, from Nazareth! Evil spirits have nothing to do with you! Have you come to destroy us all? I know who you are. You are the Holy One from God!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_35" data-id="LK4_35">Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, saying, "Be quiet and come out of him!" The demon threw the man down on the ground in the midst of the people and came out of him without harming him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_36" data-id="LK4_36">All the people in the synagogue were very amazed. They said to each other, "He speaks with confidence, and his words have so much power! Even evil spirits obey him and come out of people when he commands them to!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_37" data-id="LK4_37">And in every place throughout the surrounding regions, people kept talking about what Jesus had done.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_38" data-id="LK4_38">Then Jesus left the synagogue and went to Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was sick and had a high fever. Some people who were there asked Jesus to heal her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_39" data-id="LK4_39">So he bent over her and commanded the fever to leave her. Immediately she became well! She got up and served them some food.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_40" data-id="LK4_40">When the sun was setting that day, many people brought to Jesus their friends or relatives who were sick with various diseases. He put his hands on them and healed all of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_41" data-id="LK4_41">He also was forcing evil spirits to come out of many people. As the evil spirits left those people, they shouted to Jesus, "You are the Son of God!" But he commanded those evil spirits not to tell people about him, because they knew that he was the Messiah.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_42" data-id="LK4_42">The next morning Jesus went out to an uninhabited place. Crowds of people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_43" data-id="LK4_43">But he said to them, "I must tell people in other cities also the message about how God is going to rule everyone, because that is what I was sent to do."</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_44" data-id="LK4_44">So he kept preaching in the synagogues in various towns in the province of Judea.</span>
