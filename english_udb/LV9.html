<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_2" data-id="LV9_2">Then he said to Aaron, "Take a young bull so you can offer it for your sins, and a ram so that you can burn it whole on the altar, both of them without any defects, and offer them to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_3" data-id="LV9_3">Then say to the Israelite people, 'Take a male goat to offer it for your sins. Also take a calf and a lamb that have no defects, so that you can burn them whole on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_4" data-id="LV9_4">Also take an ox and a ram to offer them, so you may promise friendship with Yahweh, along with an offering of flour mixed with olive oil. Do this because today Yahweh is going to appear to you.'"</span>

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_5" data-id="LV9_5">After Moses gave these instructions to the Israelites, some of them brought these things and went to the courtyard in front of the sacred tent. Then all the people came near and stood in front of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_6" data-id="LV9_6">Then Moses said, "This is what Yahweh has commanded you to do, in order that his glory will appear to you."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_7" data-id="LV9_7">Then Moses said to Aaron, "Come to the altar and sacrifice the animal that is your offering to enable you to be forgiven for the sins you have committed. Also bring the animal that you will burn whole on the altar. Because of those offerings, God will forgive you and the people for the sins that you have committed. Do these things that Yahweh has commanded you to do."</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_13" data-id="LV9_13">Then they handed him the head and the pieces of the animal that would be burned, and he burned them on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_14" data-id="LV9_14">He washed the inner parts and the legs of the animal, and he burned them on the altar, on top of the other pieces of the animal.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_15" data-id="LV9_15">Then Aaron brought the animals that would be sacrifices for the Israelite people. He took a goat and slaughtered it for the people's sins, as he had done with the goat for his own offering.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_16" data-id="LV9_16">Then he brought the animal for the offering in order to burn it whole. He slaughtered it and offered it in the way that Yahweh had commanded him to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_17" data-id="LV9_17">He also brought the offering made from flour. He took a handful of it and burned it on the altar, as he had done with the animal that he had sacrificed earlier that morning.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_19" data-id="LV9_19">But he took the fat from the ox and the ram, including their fat tails that were cut close to the backbone, and all the fat that covered the livers and the kidneys.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_20" data-id="LV9_20">He put these parts on top of the breasts of those animals and carried them to the altar to burn them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_21" data-id="LV9_21">Then, doing what Moses had commanded, he lifted up in front of Yahweh the breast and the right thigh of those animals to show that those two animals completely belonged to Yahweh.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_22" data-id="LV9_22">Then Aaron lifted his arms toward the people and asked Yahweh to bless them. Then having finished making all those offerings, he stepped down from the place where the altar was.</span>
