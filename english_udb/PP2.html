<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_3" data-id="PP2_3">Never try to make yourselves more important than others nor boast about what you are doing. Instead, be humble, and in particular, honor one another more than you honor yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_4" data-id="PP2_4">Each one of you should not only be concerned about your needs. You should also be concerned about other people and help them when they have needs.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_13" data-id="PP2_13">For God is working in your hearts so that you will want to do and then actually do the good things that please him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_14" data-id="PP2_14">Do everything without complaining or arguing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_15" data-id="PP2_15">so that you neither do nor think of anything wrong as you live among unbelievers, since many of these are wicked people who call evil good. Among these wicked people you should be like the stars at night that shine in the midst of darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_16" data-id="PP2_16">Keep trusting in the message that can make you live forever. If you do this, I will rejoice at the time when the Messiah returns, because then I will know that I did not work among you uselessly.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_17" data-id="PP2_17">And I will greatly rejoice with you all, even if they kill me, and my blood pours out like something I offer to God. It will be in addition to what you sacrifice to God because you trust in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_18" data-id="PP2_18">In the same way you, too, should rejoice together with me!</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_19" data-id="PP2_19">I am trusting in the Lord Jesus to be able to send Timothy to you soon. I hope that when he returns, he will encourage me by telling me about what God is doing in your lives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_20" data-id="PP2_20">I have no one else like Timothy who genuinely cares for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_21" data-id="PP2_21">All the others whom I might send to you are concerned only about their own matters. They are not concerned enough about what Jesus the Messiah considers important.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_22" data-id="PP2_22">But you know Timothy's proven character, because as a son with a father he served me in the good news.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_23" data-id="PP2_23">I confidently expect to send Timothy to you as soon as I know what will happen to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_24" data-id="PP2_24">And because I believe that the Lord wants this to happen, I am confident that they will soon release me, and that I will come to you myself.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_25" data-id="PP2_25">I believe that I must send Epaphroditus back to you. He is a fellow believer and my fellow worker and soldier for the Messiah, and your messenger and servant whom you sent to help me in my need.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_26" data-id="PP2_26">When Epaphroditus learned that you heard he was sick, he became very worried and began longing to be there with all of you at Philippi.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_27" data-id="PP2_27">Indeed, he was so sick that he almost died, but he did not die. Instead, God was very kind to him and also to me, so that I would not have a reason to grieve much.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_28" data-id="PP2_28">So I am sending him back to you as quickly as possible. I will do this in order that you may rejoice when you see him again, and that I might grieve less.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_29" data-id="PP2_29">Welcome Epaphroditus with the great joy we have because the Lord Jesus loves us. Honor him and other believers like him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_30" data-id="PP2_30">As he was working for the Messiah, he almost died. He ran the risk of dying in order to supply the things that I needed, something you could not do because you are far away from me.</span>
