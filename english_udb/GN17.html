I want you to live your life in the way that I want. I want you to not do anything wrong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_2" data-id="GN17_2">I will confirm my covenant between us, and I will cause you to have a very great number of descendants."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_3" data-id="GN17_3">Abram bowed down with his face on the ground. Then God said to him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_4" data-id="GN17_4">"Listen to this! This is the covenant I am making with you: You will be the father of many groups of people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_5" data-id="GN17_5">Your name will be Abram no longer. Instead, your name will be Abraham, because I will make you the father of many groups of people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_6" data-id="GN17_6">I will cause you to have very, very many descendants, and I will cause nations and kings to be among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_7" data-id="GN17_7">I will make this covenant between me and you and the generations of your descendants after you forever. Because of this covenant, you will worship and follow me as God, and so will your descendants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_8" data-id="GN17_8">I will give to you and to your descendants the land of Canaan, the whole land of Canaan, where you are now living. It will be an everlasting possession for them, and I will be their God."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_9" data-id="GN17_9">Then God said to Abraham, "Now you must keep your part of the covenant that I am making with you, and your descendants must also obey it, for all generations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_10" data-id="GN17_10">This is a requirement of the covenant that I am making between myself and you and all your descendants: Every male among you must be circumcised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_11" data-id="GN17_11">Cutting the foreskins of them will be the sign that you have accepted the covenant that I am making with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_12" data-id="GN17_12">Every male child among you must be circumcised when he is eight days old, in all future generations. That includes baby boys in your household and those born from slaves that have been bought, and foreigners who live among you but do not belong to your household.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_13" data-id="GN17_13">It does not matter whether their parents are members of your household or slaves that you have bought; they must all be circumcised. Your bodies will have this mark to show you have accepted this everlasting covenant that I am making.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_14" data-id="GN17_14">You must drive out from your community any male who has not been circumcised, because that person has disobeyed my covenant."</span>

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_15" data-id="GN17_15">God also said to Abraham, "As for Sarai, your wife, you must not call her Sarai any longer. I will change her name also. Her name will now be Sarah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_16" data-id="GN17_16">I will bless her, and she will surely give birth to a son for you.

<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_17" data-id="GN17_17">Abraham lay down with his face on the ground in respect before God. But then he laughed as he said to himself, "Can a man who is a hundred years old become a father of a son? And since Sarah is ninety years old, how can she bear a child?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_18" data-id="GN17_18">Then Abraham said to God, "Perhaps you will let Ishmael receive your blessing and inherit all I possess."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_19" data-id="GN17_19">Then God replied, "No! Your wife Sarah will bear a son for you. You must name him Isaac.

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_20" data-id="GN17_20">As for Ishmael, I have heard what you asked me to do for him.

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_21" data-id="GN17_21">But it is with Isaac that I will establish my covenantâ€”Isaac, the son whom Sarah will give birth to at this time next year."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_22" data-id="GN17_22">When God finished talking to Abraham, God disappeared from his sight.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_23" data-id="GN17_23">On that same day, Abraham took his son Ishmael and all the males that were in his household, including the sons of all the slaves he had bought, and circumcised them. He cut off their foreskins, just as God told him to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_24" data-id="GN17_24">Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_25" data-id="GN17_25">and Ishmael was thirteen years old when Abraham circumcised him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_26" data-id="GN17_26">It was on that very same day that Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN17_27" data-id="GN17_27">All the males in his household, the ones who had been born there and those Abraham had bought from foreigners, were also circumcised.</span>
