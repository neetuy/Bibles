<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_1" data-id="GN9_1">Then God blessed Noah and his sons. He said to them, "I want you to have many children who will live all over the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_2" data-id="GN9_2">All the larger animals on the earth, all the birds, all the creatures that move close to the ground, and all the fish, will be very afraid of you. I place them under your authority.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_3" data-id="GN9_3">Previously I allowed you to eat green plants for food, but now you may eat everything that lives and moves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_4" data-id="GN9_4">But you must not eat meat that still has the blood in it, because the life is in its blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_5" data-id="GN9_5">I punish any creature who kills a human being—that they answer to Yahweh—whether it be an animal or from a human being. I demand that murderers must suffer for their crimes and pay with their own lives. Even when an animal kills a person, that animal must also have their life taken because they have taken the life of a human being.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_6" data-id="GN9_6">For I made people to be like myself. So I insist that if someone murders another human being, another person must kill him. Anyone who pours another's blood out must himself lose his own blood.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_7" data-id="GN9_7">As for you, I want you to produce many children, in order that they and their descendants may live all over the earth."</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_11" data-id="GN9_11">This is the covenant that I am making with you: I will never again destroy all living beings by a flood, or destroy everything else on the earth by a flood."</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_21" data-id="GN9_21">After they produced grapes, he made wine from them. One day, when he had drunk too much of the wine, he became drunk, and he lay naked in his tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_22" data-id="GN9_22">Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father lying naked in the tent. So he went outside and told his two older brothers what he had seen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_23" data-id="GN9_23">Then Shem and Japheth took a large cloth and placed it across their backs, and walked backwards into the tent. They covered their father's naked body with the cloth. Their faces were turned away from their father, so they did not see him naked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN9_24" data-id="GN9_24">When Noah woke up and was sober again, he found out how badly Ham, his youngest son, had behaved toward him.</span>
