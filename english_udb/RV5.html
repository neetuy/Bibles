<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_1" data-id="RV5_1">I saw that there was a scroll in the right hand of the one who was sitting on the throne. The scroll was written on its outside as well as on its inside, and it was sealed with seven seals.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_2" data-id="RV5_2">I saw a strong angel who was announcing in a loud voice, "The person who is worthy to break the seals of the scroll and then to open it should come and do it!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_3" data-id="RV5_3">But no created being in heaven, on the earth, or under it was able to open the scroll and see what was written on it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_4" data-id="RV5_4">I wept loudly because there was no one worthy to do that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_5" data-id="RV5_5">But one of the elders said to me, "Do not cry any longer! Look, the one who is called the Lion from the tribe of Judah, who is the descendant and heir of King David, has overcome Satan! As a result, he is worthy to break the seven seals on the scroll and to open it!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_6" data-id="RV5_6">Then I saw a Lamb standing there in the midst of the four living creatures and the elders around the throne. Although he was alive, he had marks that showed that someone had killed him. He had seven horns, and he had seven eyes that are the seven spirits of God that God sends out over all the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_7" data-id="RV5_7">The Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_8" data-id="RV5_8">When he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before him. They each had a harp, and they had golden bowls full of incense that represents the prayers of God's people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">The living creatures and the elders sang a new song. They sang:</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">"You are worthy to receive the scroll and to open its seals</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">because you were killed, and because you redeemed</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">people for God from every tribe, language, people,</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">and people group with your blood when you died.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_10" data-id="RV5_10">You have caused them to become a people over whom our God rules</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_10" data-id="RV5_10">and to become priests who serve him; they will rule on the earth."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_11" data-id="RV5_11">As I continued to look, I heard the voices of many angels around the throne and around the living creatures and the elders. There were millions of them, a crowd so large that no one could count them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_12" data-id="RV5_12">They were singing in a loud voice:</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_12" data-id="RV5_12">"The Lamb whom they killedâ€”</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_12" data-id="RV5_12">it is right that we should praise his power, wealth, wisdom, and strength.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_12" data-id="RV5_12">It is right that all created things should honor him and praise him!"</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_13" data-id="RV5_13">And I heard every creature in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea say,</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_13" data-id="RV5_13">"We must forever praise, honor, and glorify the one who sits on the throne</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_13" data-id="RV5_13">and the lamb.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v RV5_13" data-id="RV5_13">May they reign with complete power forever!"</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_14" data-id="RV5_14">The four living creatures said, "May it be so!" Then the elders prostrated themselves on the ground and worshiped God and the lamb.</span>
