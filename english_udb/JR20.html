<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_1" data-id="JR20_1">Pashhur son of Immer, was a priest who supervised the temple guards. He heard these things that I had prophesied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_2" data-id="JR20_2">So he arrested me. Then he commanded guards to whip me and fasten my feet in stocks at the Benjamin Gate of Yahweh's temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_3" data-id="JR20_3">The next day, when Pashhur released me, I said to him, "Pashhur, Yahweh is giving you a new name. From now on, your name will be 'Surrounded by Terror,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_4" data-id="JR20_4">because Yahweh says this to you: 'I will cause you and your loved ones to be terrified. You will watch them being killed by your enemies' swords. I will enable the army of the king of Babylon to capture the people of Judah. Those soldiers will take some of the people to Babylon, and they will kill others with their swords.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_5" data-id="JR20_5">And I will enable their soldiers to take away other things in Jerusalem: all your wealth and the produce of your hard work. They will take to Babylon all the very valuable things that belonged to your kings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_6" data-id="JR20_6">And as for you, Pashhur, they will take you and all your family to Babylon. You and your family and all your friends who have prophesied things that are lies will die there and be buried there.'"</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_7" data-id="JR20_7">One day I said this to Yahweh:</span>

<div class="q1">
