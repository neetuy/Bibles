<span class="v EK31_3" data-id="EK31_3">Well, Assyria was like a tall cedar tree in Lebanon;</div>

<div class="q1">
<span class="v EK31_3" data-id="EK31_3">it had big beautiful branches</div>

<div class="q1">
<span class="v EK31_3" data-id="EK31_3">It was very tall;</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_3" data-id="EK31_3">and the branches of the tallest trees made a treetop that was a roof over the forest.</div>

<div class="q1">
<span class="v EK31_4" data-id="EK31_4">Then water flowed around the base of the tree</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_4" data-id="EK31_4">into channels that took water to other nearby trees in the open countryside.</div>

<span class="v EK31_7" data-id="EK31_7">because the roots of the tree grew down into the ground where there was a plentiful supply of water.</div>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_10" data-id="EK31_10">Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: 'That tree, which represents Assyria, grew very tall; its top was higher than the other trees, and it became very proud because it was so tall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_11" data-id="EK31_11">Therefore, I enabled another mighty nation to conquer it, to destroy it as it deserved to be destroyed. I have already discarded it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_12" data-id="EK31_12">A foreign army, one that has caused people of other nations to be terrified, cut it down and left it. Its branches fell on the mountains and in the valleys. Some of its branches lay broken in all the ravines in the land. All the people of other nations came out from being under its shade and left it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_13" data-id="EK31_13">Birds of the sky settled on the fallen tree, and wild animals lived among its branches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_14" data-id="EK31_14">As a result, no other tree, even if the tree has plenty of water, will ever grow to such great height, or lift its top above the branches higher than other trees. They will all certainly die and decay; they will go to the place of the dead; they will go to the grave.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_15" data-id="EK31_15">This is what Yahweh the Lord says: "When that great tree was cut down, it was as though the springs that watered it mourned for it, because I caused the plentiful water from the springs to dry up. It was as if I had caused the mountains in Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees there to weep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_16" data-id="EK31_16">I caused the people of other nations to tremble when they heard that tree fall to the groundâ€”when they heard that Assyria had been destroyed. All the other people groups had also been like beautiful, well-watered trees in Lebanon, but they were comforted when the king represented by that cedar tree arrived among them in the place where they were as dead people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_17" data-id="EK31_17">The people represented by the trees that grew in the shade of that huge tree, the allies of the great nation that the cedar tree represents, had also died and gone down to where the dead people are.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_18" data-id="EK31_18">This parable is a warning to you people of Egypt. You think that there is no other nation that is as great and glorious as yours is. But your nation will also be destroyed, along with those other nations. Your people will be there among the other people who are not fit to worship me, people who have been killed by their enemies' swords. That is what will happen to the king of Egypt and all his many people." This is what the Lord Yahweh has declared will happen.</span>
