<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_1" data-id="GN26_1">Some time later there was a severe famine in the land. That was different from the famine that occurred when Abraham was alive. So Isaac went southeast to the city of Gerar to talk to Abimelech, the king of the Philistine people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_2" data-id="GN26_2">But Yahweh appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt! Live in the land that I tell you!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_3" data-id="GN26_3">Stay in this land, and I will help you and bless you, because it is to you and your descendants that I will give all these lands, and I will do what I solemnly promised to your father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_4" data-id="GN26_4">I will cause your descendants to be as numerous as the stars in the sky. I will give to your descendants all these lands, and I will cause your descendants to be a blessing to all the people groups on the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_5" data-id="GN26_5">I will do that because Abraham obeyed me. He obeyed all that I told him to do, all that I commanded him to do, all that I declared and all the laws that I gave him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_6" data-id="GN26_6">So Isaac stayed in Gerar along with his wife and sons.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_7" data-id="GN26_7">When the men in Gerar asked who that woman was, Isaac said, "She is my sister." He said that because he was afraid to say, "She is my wife." He thought, "Rebekah is very beautiful, so they will want her. They will kill me to get her."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_8" data-id="GN26_8">When Isaac had been there a long time, one day Abimelech, the king of the Philistine people, looked down from a window in his palace and was surprised to see Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_9" data-id="GN26_9">So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said to him, "Now I realize that she is really your wife! So why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac replied to him, "I said that because I thought that someone here might kill me to get her."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_10" data-id="GN26_10">Abimelech said, "You should not have done this to us! One of our people might have slept with your wife, and you would have caused us to be guilty of a great sin!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_11" data-id="GN26_11">Then Abimelech commanded all his people, saying, "Do not harm this man or his wife! Anyone who does that will surely be executed!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_12" data-id="GN26_12">Isaac planted grain in that land that year, and he harvested a very large crop, because Yahweh had blessed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_13" data-id="GN26_13">Isaac continued to acquire more and more possessions, until finally he became very wealthy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_14" data-id="GN26_14">He had large herds of sheep, goats, and cattle, and many slaves. Because of that, the Philistine people envied him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_15" data-id="GN26_15">So all the wells that the servants of his father Abraham had dug, the people filled up with earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_16" data-id="GN26_16">Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "You have become more numerous than we are, so I want you to leave from our area."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_17" data-id="GN26_17">So Isaac and his family moved from there. They went and set up their tents in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_18" data-id="GN26_18">There were several wells in that area that had been dug when Isaac's father Abraham was living, but Philistine people had filled them up with earth after Abraham died. But Isaac and his servants dug the wells out again, and Isaac gave the wells the same names that his father had given to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_19" data-id="GN26_19">Isaac's servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_20" data-id="GN26_20">But the men who herded animals in the Valley of Gerar argued with the men who took care of Isaac's animals. They said, "The water in this well is ours!" So Isaac named the well Esek, which means "dispute," because they disputed about who owned it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_21" data-id="GN26_21">Then Isaac's servants dug another well, but they quarreled about who owned that one also. So Isaac named it Sitnah, which means "opposition."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_22" data-id="GN26_22">They moved on from there and dug another well, but this time no one quarreled about who owned it. So he named it Rehoboth, which means "empty place," saying, "Yahweh has given us an empty place to live in, a place that is not wanted by other people, and we will become very prosperous here."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_23" data-id="GN26_23">From there Isaac went up to Beersheba.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_24" data-id="GN26_24">The first night that he was there, Yahweh appeared to him and said, "I am the God whom your father Abraham worshiped. Do not be afraid of anything. I will help you and bless you, and because of what I promised my servant Abraham, I will greatly increase the number of your descendants."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_25" data-id="GN26_25">So Isaac built an altar there and offered a sacrifice to worship Yahweh. He set up their tents there, and his servants started to dig a well.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_26" data-id="GN26_26">While they were digging the well, King Abimelech came to Isaac from Gerar, along with Ahuzzath, his advisor, and Phicol, the commander of his army.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_27" data-id="GN26_27">Isaac asked them, "You acted in a hostile way toward me before and sent me away. So why have you come to me now?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_28" data-id="GN26_28">One of them answered, "We have seen that Yahweh helps you. So we said to each other, 'We should have an agreement between ourselves and Isaac.' So we should make a peace treaty with you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_29" data-id="GN26_29">stating that you will not harm us, in the same way that we did not molest you. We always treated you well, and we sent you away peacefully. And now Yahweh is blessing you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_30" data-id="GN26_30">So Isaac made a feast for them, and they all ate and drank.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_31" data-id="GN26_31">Early the next morning they all swore to each other that they would do what they had promised. Then Isaac sent them home peacefully.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_32" data-id="GN26_32">That day Isaac's servants came to him and told him about the well that they had finished digging. They said, "We found water in the well!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_33" data-id="GN26_33">Isaac named the well Shibah, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means "oath." To the present time the town there has the name Beersheba which means "peace treaty well."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_34" data-id="GN26_34">When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon. Both of those women were descendants of Heth, not from Isaac's clan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_35" data-id="GN26_35">Esau's two wives made life miserable for Isaac and Rebekah.</span>
