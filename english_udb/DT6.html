<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_1" data-id="DT6_1">"These are the commandments and rules and decrees that Yahweh our God commanded me to teach to you. He wants you to obey them in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_2" data-id="DT6_2">He wants you to honor him, and he wants you and your descendants to always obey all these rules and regulations that I am giving to you, in order that you may live for a long time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_3" data-id="DT6_3">So, you Israelite people, listen to them carefully and obey them. If you do that, things will go well with you, and you will become a very numerous nation when you are living in that very fertile land. That is what Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped, promised would happen.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_4" data-id="DT6_4">You Israelite people, listen! Only Yahweh is our God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_5" data-id="DT6_5">You must love him with all your inner being and with all that you feel and in every way that you can.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_6" data-id="DT6_6">Never forget these commands that I am giving to you today.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_7" data-id="DT6_7">Teach them to your children again and again. Talk about them all the time. When you are in your houses and when you are walking outside, talk about them also when you are lying down and when you wake up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_8" data-id="DT6_8">Write them on tiny scrolls and fasten them to your arms, and write them on bands that you fasten to your foreheads to help you to remember them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_9" data-id="DT6_9">Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your city gates.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_10" data-id="DT6_10">Yahweh our God solemnly promised to your ancestors Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that he would give you a land that already has in it large and prosperous cities that you did not build.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_11" data-id="DT6_11">He said that the houses in those cities will already be full of many good things that someone else put there; you did not put them there. There will be wells that someone else dug. There will be vineyards and olive trees that someone else planted. So when Yahweh brings you into that land, and you have all that you want to eat,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_12" data-id="DT6_12">be sure that you do not forget Yahweh, who rescued you from being slaves in Egypt and gave all these things to you.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_13" data-id="DT6_13">You must honor Yahweh our God, and you must worship him alone. When you make a solemn oath to tell the truth or to do something, do it in his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_14" data-id="DT6_14">You must not worship any other gods, the gods that the people groups who live in this land worship.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_15" data-id="DT6_15">Yahweh our God, who lives among you, will not accept people who worship anyone or anything else. So if you worship any other god, Yahweh will be very angry with you, and he will destroy you completely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_16" data-id="DT6_16">Do not do sinful things to find out whether Yahweh will punish you or not, like your ancestors did at Massah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_17" data-id="DT6_17">Be sure that you always obey all the laws, the weighty instructions, and the regulations that he has given to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_18" data-id="DT6_18">Do what Yahweh says is right and good. If you do that, things will go well with you. You will be able to enter and occupy the good land that Yahweh solemnly promised to give to our ancestors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_19" data-id="DT6_19">He will do that by driving out your enemies from that land, just as he promised to do.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_20" data-id="DT6_20">In the future, your children will ask you, 'Why did Yahweh our God command us to obey all these rules and decrees?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_21" data-id="DT6_21">Then you will tell them, 'Our ancestors were slaves of the king in Egypt, but Yahweh brought them out of Egypt by his great power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_22" data-id="DT6_22">They saw him do many kinds of miracles and terrifying things to the people of Egypt and to the king and his officials.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_23" data-id="DT6_23">He rescued our ancestors from Egypt and brought them here to give them this land, just as he solemnly promised our ancestors that he would do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_24" data-id="DT6_24">And he commanded us to obey all these laws and to honor him, so that things would go well with us, and so that he would protect our nation and enable us to prosper, as he is doing now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT6_25" data-id="DT6_25">Yahweh our God will approve of us if we carefully obey everything that he has commanded us to do.'"</span>
