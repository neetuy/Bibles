<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_4" data-id="LV8_4">Moses did what Yahweh told him to do, and all the people gathered there.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_5" data-id="LV8_5">Then Moses said to the people, "This is what Yahweh has commanded us to do."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_6" data-id="LV8_6">Then he brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_7" data-id="LV8_7">He put the special tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, put on him the special robe, and put on him the sacred vest. He fastened the sacred vest around him, using the finely woven waistband.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_8" data-id="LV8_8">He put the sacred pouch on his chest and put into it the two stones for him to use to determine what God wants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_9" data-id="LV8_9">Then he wrapped the turban around Aaron's head and fastened on the front of it the gold ornament the object that showed that he was dedicated to God, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_10" data-id="LV8_10">Then Moses took the olive oil and anointed the sacred tent and everything in it, and dedicated it all to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_11" data-id="LV8_11">He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times. He anointed the altar and all the things used with it, and its huge washbasin and its stand, to dedicate them to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_12" data-id="LV8_12">He poured some of the oil on Aaron's head and anointed him, to dedicate him to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_13" data-id="LV8_13">Then he brought forward Aaron's sons. He put tunics on them, tied sashes around them, and wrapped turbans around their heads, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_14" data-id="LV8_14">Then he brought the bull for the offering to cause people to become acceptable to God. Then Aaron and his sons put their hands on the bull's head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_15" data-id="LV8_15">Then Moses slaughtered the bull, caught some of its blood in a bowl, and with his finger put some of it on the projections at the corners of the altar, to purify the altar. He poured the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. By doing that, he caused it to be a suitable place for burning sacrifices for sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_16" data-id="LV8_16">Moses took all the fat that covers the inner parts of the animal, including the liver and kidneys, and burned them on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_17" data-id="LV8_17">He took the rest of the bull, including the hide and intestines, and burned them outside the camp, like Yahweh had commanded Moses.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_18" data-id="LV8_18">Then he brought the ram for the offering that would be completely burned on the altar, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_19" data-id="LV8_19">Then Moses slaughtered the ram and sprinkled its blood on all sides of the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">20-21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_20-21" data-id="LV8_20-21">He cut the ram into pieces and washed the inner parts and hind legs. Then he put the head, the fat, and the other parts of the ram on the altar. As it burned, the aroma of the smoke was pleasing to Yahweh. It was an offering to Yahweh that was burned, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_22" data-id="LV8_22">Then he brought the other ram, the one for consecrating the priests, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">23-24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_23-24" data-id="LV8_23-24">Moses slaughtered that ram, caught some of its blood in a bowl, and put some of that blood on the lobes of the right ears, the thumbs of the right hands, and the big toes of the right feet of Aaron and his sons to indicate that what they listened to and what they did and where they went should be directed by Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_25" data-id="LV8_25">He picked up all the fat of the ram, its fat tail, the fat that covered the inner parts, including the fat that covered the liver and kidneys, and the right thigh of the ram.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">26-27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_26-27" data-id="LV8_26-27">Then from the basket containing the bread that was made without yeast, the bread which had been dedicated to Yahweh, he picked up one loaf of bread made without olive oil, and one loaf that was made by mixing the flour with olive oil, and one wafer. He put those on top of the portions of fat, and put them into the hands of Aaron and his sons. Then they lifted them up in the presence of Yahweh to show that it was an offering that belonged to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_28" data-id="LV8_28">Then Moses took those things from their hands and burned them on the altar. That was the offering that was burned to appoint Aaron and his sons as priests. And the aroma while it burned was pleasing to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_29" data-id="LV8_29">Moses also took the breast of the second ram and lifted it high before Yahweh to offer it to him, as Yahweh had commanded. The breast was Moses' share of the ram that was sacrificed to dedicate the priests.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_30" data-id="LV8_30">Then Moses took some of the olive oil for anointing Aaron and his sons, and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his sons and on their clothes. By doing that, he set apart Aaron to be priest, together with his sons and their clothes.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_31" data-id="LV8_31">Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons, "Boil the meat of the second ram at the entrance of the sacred tent, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket, as I told you to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_32" data-id="LV8_32">Burn up any of the meat and bread that remains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_33" data-id="LV8_33">The time for you to be set apart as priests will be seven days, so do not leave the entrance of the sacred tent for seven days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_34" data-id="LV8_34">What we have done today is what Yahweh commanded to cause you to be forgiven for your sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_35" data-id="LV8_35">You must stay at the entrance to the sacred tent for seven days and seven nights and do what Yahweh requires, in order that you will not die because of disobeying him. I am telling you that because that is what Yahweh has commanded me to tell you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_36" data-id="LV8_36">So Aaron and his sons did everything that Yahweh told Moses to tell them.</span>
