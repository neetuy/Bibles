<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_1" data-id="EX10_1">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the king again. I have made him and his officials stubborn. I have done so in order that I may have a good reason to do all these miracles among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_2" data-id="EX10_2">I have also done so in order that you would be able to tell your children and your grandchildren how I caused the Egyptians to act very foolishly when I performed all these miracles. Then all of you will know that I am Yahweh God."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_3" data-id="EX10_3">So Aaron and Moses went to the king and said to him, "Yahweh God, the one whom we Hebrews worship, says this, 'How long will you stubbornly refuse to do what I tell you? Let my people go in order that they may worship me in the wilderness!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_4" data-id="EX10_4">If you do not let them go, I warn you that tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_5" data-id="EX10_5">They will cover the ground so that you will not even be able to see it. They will eat everything that the ice storm did not destroy. They will eat everything that is left on the trees that is still growing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_6" data-id="EX10_6">They will fill your houses and the houses of all your officials and of all the rest of the Egyptians. There will be more locusts than you or your parents or your grandparents have ever seen from the time your ancestors first came to this land until now!'" Then Moses, along with Aaron, turned and left the king.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_7" data-id="EX10_7">The king's officials said to him, "How long is this man going to bring bad things upon us? Let the Israelites go in order that they may worship Yahweh, their god. Do you not yet understand that this man has ruined Egypt?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_8" data-id="EX10_8">So they brought Aaron and Moses back to the king. He said to them, "All right, you can go and worship Yahweh, your god. But who are the ones who will go?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_9" data-id="EX10_9">Moses replied, "We all need to go, everyone, including those who are young and those who are old. We need to take our sons, our daughters, and our flocks of sheep, goats, and herds of livestock because we must have a festival to honor Yahweh."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_10" data-id="EX10_10">So the king replied, "I never want Yahweh to help you, and I myself will never let you take your children and your wives with you! It is clear that you are planning not to return.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_11" data-id="EX10_11">So, no, I will not let you all go. The Israelite men may go and worship Yahweh if that is what you want." Then the king drove Moses and Aaron from his palace.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_12" data-id="EX10_12">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Reach out your hand as though you were stretching it over the land to welcome the locusts. They will come to the country of Egypt and eat every plant that is left in the land, every plant that the ice storm did not destroy."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_13" data-id="EX10_13">So Moses held out his staff as though he were stretching it over the whole land of Egypt. Then Yahweh caused a strong wind to blow from the east, and it blew over the land all that day and all that night. By the next morning, it had brought the locusts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_14" data-id="EX10_14">The locusts swarmed all over Egypt. The swarm of locusts was larger than any that had ever been seen in Egypt, and there will never be a swarm of locusts like that again in the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_15" data-id="EX10_15">They covered the surface of the ground and made it appear black. They ate all the plants in the land and everything on the trees that had not been destroyed by the ice storm. Nothing that was green was left on any plant or on any tree anywhere in Egypt.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_16" data-id="EX10_16">The king quickly called Aaron and Moses and said, "I have sinned against Yahweh, your god, and against you two.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_17" data-id="EX10_17">So now I ask you to forgive me this one time for having sinned. Please pray to Yahweh, your god, to take away this terrible disaster that will cause us all to die."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_18" data-id="EX10_18">So Moses and Aaron left the king, and Moses prayed to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_19" data-id="EX10_19">Then Yahweh changed the wind so that it blew strongly from the west, and it blew all the locusts into the Sea of Reeds. There was not one locust left anywhere in the country of Egypt.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_20" data-id="EX10_20">But Yahweh made the king stubborn again, and the king did not let the Israelite people go.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_21" data-id="EX10_21">Yahweh said to Moses, "Reach your hand up toward the sky in order that there may be darkness over all the land of Egypt, a darkness so complete that people will have to feel around to know where to walk."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_22" data-id="EX10_22">So Moses reached his hand toward the sky, and it became very dark all over Egypt for three days and nights.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_23" data-id="EX10_23">People could not see each other. No one left his house during that whole time. But there was light in the area where the Israelite people lived.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_24" data-id="EX10_24">The king called Moses and said, "All right, you may go and worship Yahweh. Your wives and your children may go with you. But your flocks of sheep and goats and your herds of cattle must remain here."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_25" data-id="EX10_25">But Moses replied, "No, you must let us take along the sheep and goats in order that we may have some of them to sacrifice and give as burnt offerings to Yahweh, our God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_26" data-id="EX10_26">Our livestock must also go with us; we are not going to leave one animal behind. We must take them to worship Yahweh. We will not know which animals to sacrifice until we get to where we are going."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_27" data-id="EX10_27">But Yahweh made the king continue to be stubborn. The king would not let the Israelite people go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_28" data-id="EX10_28">The king said to Moses and Aaron, "Get out of here! Make sure that you never come to see me again! The day you see me again, I will have you killed!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_29" data-id="EX10_29">Moses replied, "You are correct! You will never see me again!"</span>
