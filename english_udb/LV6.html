<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_5" data-id="LV6_5">You must not only return anything like that to its owner, but you must also pay to the owner an additional one-fifth of its value.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_7" data-id="LV6_7">Then the priest will offer that ram to be a sacrifice that will cause you to no longer be guilty, and I will forgive you for the wrong things that you did."</span>
