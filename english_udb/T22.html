<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_2" data-id="T22_2">Many other people can also testify about the message that you heard from me. Entrust this message to other people whom you can trust, because they will be qualified to teach others.</span>

<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_3" data-id="T22_3">Endure as I do what we suffer for Jesus the Messiah, like a good soldier endures what he suffers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_4" data-id="T22_4">You know that soldiers, in order to please their captain, do not become involved in civilian affairs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_5" data-id="T22_5">Likewise, athletes competing in games cannot win unless they obey the rules.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_9" data-id="T22_9">For this good news I suffer to the point of being imprisoned as a criminal. But the word of God is not in prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_10" data-id="T22_10">Therefore I willingly endure all that I am suffering for the sake of those whom God has chosen.

<span class="v T22_12" data-id="T22_12">But if we deny him, he also will deny us.</div>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_16" data-id="T22_16">Stay away from people who talk in ways that insult God, because this kind of talk causes people to dishonor God more and more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_17" data-id="T22_17">This kind of words will spread like an infectious disease. Hymenaeus and Philetus are two examples of men who talk like this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_18" data-id="T22_18">These men have stopped believing what is true. They wrongly say that the resurrection of the dead has already happened. In this way they convince some Christians to stop trusting in the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_19" data-id="T22_19">However, the truth about God still exists like . It is like a firm foundation of a building, on which someone has written these words: "The Lord knows those who belong to him" and "Everyone who says he belongs to the Lord must stop doing wicked deeds."</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_20" data-id="T22_20">In a wealthy person's house there are not only dishes made of gold and of silver, but also dishes made of wood and of clay.

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_21" data-id="T22_21">Therefore, those who rid themselves of what is evil in their lives will be like dishes that are ready for any kind of good work.

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_22" data-id="T22_22">You must avoid doing the sinful things that young people usually desire. Instead, to things that are right. Trust in God and love him. Live together in peace with the people who worship the Lord sincerely.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_23" data-id="T22_23">Do not talk with anyone about matters that are foolish and not important. Do not talk with them, because you know that when people talk about foolish things, they begin to quarrel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_24" data-id="T22_24">But the one who serves the Lord must not quarrel. Instead, he should be kind to all people, he should be able to teach God's truth well, and he should be patient with people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_25" data-id="T22_25">That is, he should gently instruct the people who argue against him. Perhaps God may give them the opportunity to repent and come to know the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_26" data-id="T22_26">In that way they may think correctly and be like people who have escaped from a trap set by the devil. It is the devil who has deceived them in order to get them to do what he wishes them to do.</span>
