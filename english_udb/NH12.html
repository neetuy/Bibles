They all were playing the same kinds of musical instruments that King David had played many years previously. Ezra, the man who knew the Jewish laws very well, marched in front of this group.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_37" data-id="NH12_37">When they reached the Fountain Gate, they went up the steps to the city of David, past the location of David's palace, and then to the wall at the Water Gate, on the east side of the city.</span>

<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_38" data-id="NH12_38">The other choir who were singing and thanking Yahweh marched to the left on top of the wall.

<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_39" data-id="NH12_39">From there we marched past Ephraim Gate, Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred Soldiers, to the Sheep Gate. We finished marching near the gate into the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_40" data-id="NH12_40">Both the groups reached the house of God as they were singing and thanking him. They stood in their places there. I and the leaders who were with me also stood in our places.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_41" data-id="NH12_41">My group included the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with their trumpets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_42" data-id="NH12_42">There was another named Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang with Jezrahiah who was their leader.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_43" data-id="NH12_43">After we went outside the temple, we offered many sacrifices. We men all rejoiced because God had caused us to be very happy. The women and the children also rejoiced. People far away could hear the noise that we made there in Jerusalem.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_44" data-id="NH12_44">On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms where they kept the money that people gave for the temple. They also were in charge of the tithes and the first part of the grain and fruit that was harvested each year. They also brought into the storerooms a part of the harvest from the fields for the priests and the descendants of Levi. This was done because the people of Judah were so happy to have servants serving in the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_45" data-id="NH12_45">The priests and Levites were serving Yahweh in their rituals to purify things, and the musicians in the temple and the gatekeepers also did their work as King David and his son Solomon had declared that they should do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_46" data-id="NH12_46">Ever since the time of David and Asaph, there have been directors of the singers, and they sang songs to praise and thank God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_47" data-id="NH12_47">During the years of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, all Israel contributed the food that the singers and temple gatekeepers needed every day. They set aside what the Levites needed to live on, and the Levites set aside for the descendants of Aaron, the first leader of all the priests, what they needed.</span>
