They have turned away from me, like a woman who has abandoned her husband and sleeps with other men. They have gone up on every hilltop and under every shady tree and worshiped idols there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_7" data-id="JR3_7">I thought that they would return to me, but they did not. And their brothers, the people of Judah, were watching all of this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_8" data-id="JR3_8">So I sent the people of Israel away to other countries, as a man writes a note saying that he is divorcing his wife and then sends her away because she has committed adultery. But I realized that, just as the people of Israel, the people of Judah were not at all afraid of me. Instead, they acted just as the people of Israel had done. They also turned away from me and began worshiping idols, just as women who leave their husbands and go to other men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_9" data-id="JR3_9">They did not care that worshiping idols offended me, so they have made the entire land unacceptable to me by worshiping idols of wood and stone.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_11" data-id="JR3_11">Then Yahweh said to me, "Jeremiah, the people of Israel have turned away from me, but what the people of Judah have done is worse.</span>
