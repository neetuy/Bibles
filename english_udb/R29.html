<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R29_7" data-id="R29_7">The men who work for you are very fortunate! Your servants who are constantly standing in front of you and listening to the wise things that you say are also fortunate!</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R29_8" data-id="R29_8">I praise Yahweh your God, who has shown that he is pleased with you by appointing you to be the king of Israel for him.
