<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_4" data-id="LV5_4">If you carelessly make a solemn promise to do something that is either good or that is bad, when you realize that you cannot do it, you must pay a penalty.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_5" data-id="LV5_5">If you are guilty of committing any of those sins, you must confess what you have done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_6" data-id="LV5_6">And as a penalty, you must bring to Yahweh a female lamb or female goat as an offering for the sin that you have committed, and the priest will sacrifice it, and then you will no longer be guilty for your sin.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_7" data-id="LV5_7">If you are poor and cannot afford to bring a lamb, you must bring to Yahweh two doves or two pigeons.

<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_8" data-id="LV5_8">You must bring them to the priest. First he will offer one of them to be an offering for your sin. He will wring its neck to kill it, but he must not pull off its head completely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_9" data-id="LV5_9">Then he must sprinkle some of the blood against the side of the altar. The remaining blood must be drained out at the base of the altar. That will be an offering for your sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_10" data-id="LV5_10">The priest will then do what I have commanded and offer the other bird to be completely burned on the altar.

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_11" data-id="LV5_11">However, if you are very poor and cannot afford two doves or two pigeons, you must bring to be an offering for your sin two liters of fine flour. You must not put olive oil or incense on it, because it is an offering for sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_12" data-id="LV5_12">You must take it to the priest. He will take a handful of it to symbolize that the whole offering truly belongs to Yahweh, and burn it on the altar, on top of the other offerings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_13" data-id="LV5_13">When he does that, the priest will enable you to no longer be guilty for any of the sins that you have committed, and God will forgive you.

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_14" data-id="LV5_14">Yahweh also said to Moses to tell the people:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_15" data-id="LV5_15">"When you sin, without intending to, by not giving to me, Yahweh, the things that you are required to give to him, you must pay a penalty by bringing to me a ram that has no defects. You must determine how much silver it is worth, by using the official standard in the sacred tent. It will be an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_16" data-id="LV5_16">But you must also make restitution for failing to pay him what has been set apart as only for him. Also, you must add one-fifth of its value. You must give that to the priest. He will offer the ram as a sacrifice for the sin that you have committed and cause you to no longer be guilty, and I will forgive you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_17" data-id="LV5_17">If you sin by doing something that is forbidden in any of my commands, even if you do not know that you have disobeyed one of my commands, you are still guilty; you must pay a penalty to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_18" data-id="LV5_18">When you realize what you have done, you must bring a ram to the priest as an offering in order that you will no longer be guilty. You must bring one that has no defects. The priest will offer the ram to be a sacrifice to me, and as a result you will no longer be guilty for the sin that you have committed, and I will forgive you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_19" data-id="LV5_19">It is an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty for sinning against me."</span>
