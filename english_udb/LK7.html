<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_1" data-id="LK7_1">After Jesus finished speaking to the people, he went to the town of Capernaum.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_2" data-id="LK7_2">In that town there was a centurion in the Roman army who had a slave that was dear to him. This slave was so sick that he was about to die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_3" data-id="LK7_3">When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to Jesus to ask him to come and heal his slave.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_4" data-id="LK7_4">When they came to Jesus, they earnestly asked him to help the centurion's slave. They said, "He deserves that you do this for him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_5" data-id="LK7_5">because he loves our people and he built our synagogue for us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_6" data-id="LK7_6">So Jesus went with them to the officer's house. When he was almost there, the officer sent some friends to give this message to Jesus: "Lord, do not trouble yourself any further, since I am not worthy that you should come into my house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_7" data-id="LK7_7">That is why I do not think that I am worthy to come to you myself. But you can heal my slave if you say just one word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_8" data-id="LK7_8">I know that you can do this because I am a man who must obey the orders of my superiors, and I also have soldiers who must obey my orders. When I say to one of them, 'Go!', he goes, and when I say to another, 'Come!', he comes. When I say to my slave, 'Do this!', he does it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_9" data-id="LK7_9">When Jesus heard what the officer had said, he was amazed at him. Then he turned to the crowd that was with him and said, "I tell you, I have not found any Israelite who trusts me as much as this Gentile does!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_10" data-id="LK7_10">When those people who had come from the centurion returned to his house, they found out that the slave was in good health again.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_11" data-id="LK7_11">Soon after that, Jesus traveled to the town of Nain. His disciples and a large crowd went with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_12" data-id="LK7_12">As Jesus came near to the town gate, he saw a large crowd coming out of the town, carrying a man who had just died. Now his mother was a widow, and he was her only son. She was with the crowd, and they were going to bury her son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_13" data-id="LK7_13">When the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, "Do not cry!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_14" data-id="LK7_14">Then he came close to them and touched the stretcher on which the body was lying. The men carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_15" data-id="LK7_15">The man sat up and began to talk! Then Jesus led him back to his mother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_16" data-id="LK7_16">Everyone there was overcome with awe. They praised God and said to each other, "A great prophet has come among us!" and "God has come to care for his people!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_17" data-id="LK7_17">Then this news about what Jesus had done spread throughout the region of Judea and all the other nearby areas.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">18-19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_18-19" data-id="LK7_18-19">The disciples of John the Baptizer told him about all these things. So John called for two of his disciples and told them to go to the Lord and ask him: "Are you the one whom God promised would come, or should we be expecting someone else?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_20" data-id="LK7_20">When those two men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptizer sent us to ask you, 'Are you the one whom God promised would come, or should we expect someone else?'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_21" data-id="LK7_21">At that same time Jesus was healing many people from sicknesses and serious diseases, and from evil spirits. He also healed many blind people so that they were able to see.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_22" data-id="LK7_22">So he answered those two men, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: People who were blind are now seeing. People who were lame are now walking. People who had skin diseases are being healed. People who were deaf can now hear. People who were dead are being made to live again and good news is being proclaimed to the poor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_23" data-id="LK7_23">And also tell him, "God will bless anyone who sees what I do and hears what I teach and does not turn away from me."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_24" data-id="LK7_24">When the men whom John had sent left, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said, "What did you go into the wilderness to see? A thin stalk of a plant shaken by the wind?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_25" data-id="LK7_25">But what did you go out to see? A man in fancy clothing? Look, those who wear splendid clothes and who have the best of everything live in kings' palaces.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_26" data-id="LK7_26">Then what did you go out there to see? A prophet? Yes! But I tell you that John is more important than an ordinary prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_27" data-id="LK7_27">He is the one about whom the prophets wrote long ago: 'See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare people for your coming.'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_28" data-id="LK7_28">I tell you that of all the people who ever lived, there is no one greater than John. Yet the most insignificant people who will live with God where he dwells will be greater than John."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_29" data-id="LK7_29">When all the people who had been baptized by John heard what Jesus said—including the tax collectors—they agreed that God was just.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_30" data-id="LK7_30">But the Pharisees and the experts in the Jewish laws had not been baptized by John and they rejected God's will for them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_31" data-id="LK7_31">Then Jesus also said, "What are you people living in this time period like? I will tell you:</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_32" data-id="LK7_32">You are like children playing games in an open area. They call out to each other, saying, "We played happy music for you on the flute, but you did not dance! Then we sang sad funeral songs for you, but you did not cry!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_33" data-id="LK7_33">Similarly, when John came to you and did not eat ordinary food or drink wine, you rejected him and said, 'A demon is controlling him!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_34" data-id="LK7_34">But when the Son of Man came to you and he ate ordinary food and drank wine as others do, then you rejected him and said, 'Look! This man eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and other sinners!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_35" data-id="LK7_35">But God's wisdom is proved right by those who follow it.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_36" data-id="LK7_36">One day a certain Pharisee named Simon invited Jesus to eat a meal with him. So Jesus went to the man's house and reclined at a table to eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_37" data-id="LK7_37">There was also a woman in that city whom many people knew had been a prostitute. When she heard that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee's house, she went there, taking a stone jar that contained perfume.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_38" data-id="LK7_38">As Jesus was reclining to eat, the woman stood behind him at his feet. She was crying, and her tears fell on Jesus' feet. She continually wiped his feet with her hair, and kept kissing them and anointing them with the perfume.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_39" data-id="LK7_39">When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw what the woman was doing, he thought, "If this man were really a prophet, he would have known who this woman is who is touching him, and what kind of person she is, that she is a sinner. "</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_40" data-id="LK7_40">In response, Jesus said to him, "Simon, there is something I want to tell you." He replied, "Teacher, what is it?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_41" data-id="LK7_41">Jesus told him this story: "Two people owed money to a man who had a business lending money to people. One of these people owed him five hundred silver coins, and the other one owed him fifty silver coins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_42" data-id="LK7_42">Neither of them was able to pay back what he owed, so the man very kindly said that they did not have to pay back anything. So, which of those two men will love that man more?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_43" data-id="LK7_43">Simon replied, "I assume that the one who had owed him the most money will love him more." Jesus said to him, "You are correct."</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_44" data-id="LK7_44">Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Think about what this woman has done! When I entered your house, you did not do what hosts usually do to welcome their guests. You did not give me any water to wash my feet, but this woman has washed my feet with her tears and then wiped them with her hair!</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_45" data-id="LK7_45">You did not greet me with a kiss, but from the moment I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet!</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_46" data-id="LK7_46">You did not anoint my head with olive oil, but she has anointed my feet with fragrant perfume.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_47" data-id="LK7_47">So I tell you that she has been forgiven for her many sins and that is why she loves me very much. But a person who thinks he has only a few sins, and has been forgiven, will love me only a little bit."</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_48" data-id="LK7_48">Then he said to the woman, "You have been forgiven for your sins."</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_49" data-id="LK7_49">Then those who were eating with him said among themselves, "Who is this man who says that he can forgive sins?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK7_50" data-id="LK7_50">But Jesus said to the woman, "Because you have believed in me, God has saved you. May God give you peace as you go!"</span>
