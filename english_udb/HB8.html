<div class="c">8</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_1" data-id="HB8_1">The most important part of everything that I have written is that we have a high priest who has sat down to rule in the place of greatest honor in heaven, beside God himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_2" data-id="HB8_2">He serves in the sanctuary, that is, in the true place of worship in heaven. That is the true sacred tent, for the Lord set it up, not Moses.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_3" data-id="HB8_3">God appoints every high priest to offer gifts and sacrifices for the people's sins. So since the Messiah became a high priest, he also had to offer something.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_4" data-id="HB8_4">Since there are already priests who offer gifts as God's law requires, if the Messiah were now living on the earth, he would not be a high priest at all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_5" data-id="HB8_5">The priests in Jerusalem perform rituals that are only a copy of what the Messiah does in heaven. This is because when Moses was about to set up the sacred tent, God told him, "Be sure that you make everything according to what I showed you on Mount Sinai!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_6" data-id="HB8_6">But now the Messiah serves in a much better way than the Jewish priests do. In the same way, the new covenant that he established between God and people is better than the old one. When he established the new covenant, he promised us better things than the laws that God gave Moses.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_7" data-id="HB8_7">God needed to make this new covenant, because the first covenant had not done everything well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_8" data-id="HB8_8">Because God declared that the Israelites were guilty of not obeying the first covenant, he wanted a new covenant. This is what a prophet wrote about that:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_8" data-id="HB8_8">"The Lord says, 'Listen! There will soon be a time</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_8" data-id="HB8_8">when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and the people of Judah.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_9" data-id="HB8_9">That covenant will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_9" data-id="HB8_9">when I led them out of Egypt like a father leads his young child.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_9" data-id="HB8_9">They did not continue to obey my covenant,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_9" data-id="HB8_9">so I let them alone,' says the Lord.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_10" data-id="HB8_10">'This is the covenant that I will make with the Israelites,</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_10" data-id="HB8_10">after the first covenant has ended,' says the Lord:</div>

<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_10" data-id="HB8_10">'I will enable them to understand my laws,</div>

<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_10" data-id="HB8_10">I will be their God, and they will be my people.</div>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_11" data-id="HB8_11">No one will need to teach a fellow citizen</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_12" data-id="HB8_12">I will no longer consider that they are guilty for their sins."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_13" data-id="HB8_13">Since God said that he was making a new covenant, we know that he considered that the first covenant was no longer in use, and that it would soon disappear.</span>
