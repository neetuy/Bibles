<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_1" data-id="IS6_1">During the year that King Uzziah died, Yahweh showed me a vision. In the vision, I saw Yahweh sitting on a throne, high above everyone else. He was wearing a very long robe that covered the floor of the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_2" data-id="IS6_2">Above him were hovering several winged creatures. Each of them had six wings. They covered their faces with two of their wings, they covered their feet with two of their wings, and they flew using two of their wings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_3" data-id="IS6_3">They were calling to each other, saying,</span>

<div class="q1">
<span class="v IS6_3" data-id="IS6_3">"Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, is holy;</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v IS6_3" data-id="IS6_3">he is completely holy!</div>

<div class="q1">
<span class="v IS6_3" data-id="IS6_3">The entire earth is filled with his glory."</div>

<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_4" data-id="IS6_4">When they spoke, the sound of their cries caused the foundation beneath the doorposts of the temple to shake, and the temple was filled with smoke.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_5" data-id="IS6_5">Then I said, "Terrible things will happen to me, because everything that I say is sinful, and I live among people who constantly say sinful things. I will be destroyed because I have seen Yahweh, commander of the angel armies!"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_6" data-id="IS6_6">Then one of the winged creatures took a hot coal from the altar, using a pair of tongs. He flew to me</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_7" data-id="IS6_7">and touched my lips with the coal. Then he said, "Look, this coal has touched your lips. Now your guilt is ended, and your sins are forgiven."</span>
