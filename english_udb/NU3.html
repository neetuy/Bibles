<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_2" data-id="NU3_2">Aaron had four sons. They were Nadab the oldest, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_3" data-id="NU3_3">These are the names of Aaron's sons who were anointed priests and set apart as priests and whom he ordained to serve as priests.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_4" data-id="NU3_4">But, while Yahweh was watching, Nadab and Abihu died in the wilderness of Sinai because they burned incense in a manner that was disobedient to what Yahweh had commanded. They had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar were the only sons of Aaron who were left to be priests, along with their father Aaron.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_5" data-id="NU3_5">Then Yahweh said to Moses,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_6" data-id="NU3_6">"Bring the men of the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron, in order that they may assist him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_9" data-id="NU3_9">Appoint them to help Aaron and his two sons. I have chosen them from all the Israelite people to do that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_10" data-id="NU3_10">Appoint Aaron and his two sons to do the work that priests do. But anyone else who comes close to the sacred tent to do that work must be executed."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_11" data-id="NU3_11">Yahweh also told Moses,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_12" data-id="NU3_12">"Note that from all the Israelites I have chosen the men of the tribe of Levi to take the places of all the firstborn sons of the Israelite people. The male descendants of Levi belong to me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_13" data-id="NU3_13">because truly all the firstborn males belong to me. That is because on the day that I killed all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt, I spared all the firstborn sons of the Israelites and set them apart for myself. I also set apart the firstborn males of your domestic animals. They belong to me, Yahweh."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_14" data-id="NU3_14">Yahweh spoke to Moses again in the wilderness of Sinai. He said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU3_16" data-id="NU3_16">So Moses counted them, just as Yahweh commanded.</span>
