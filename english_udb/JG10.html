<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG10_6" data-id="JG10_6">The Israelites did even more evil that Yahweh saw them do. They worshiped the Baal idols and female fertility idols called the Asthoreths. They worshiped the gods of the people groups of Aram, Sidon, Moab, and Ammon people groups, and the gods of the Philistines. They forgot about Yahweh and stopped worshiping him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG10_7" data-id="JG10_7">So Yahweh was very angry with them, and he allowed the Philistines and Ammonites to conquer Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG10_8" data-id="JG10_8">They crushed and oppressed the Israelites that year, and for eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel who lived on the east side of the Jordan River.

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG10_11" data-id="JG10_11">Yahweh answered them, saying, "I delivered you from the people groups of the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG10_12" data-id="JG10_12">and also from the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites. I did this because they hurt and imprisoned you. You cried out to me, and I brought you to freedom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG10_13" data-id="JG10_13">But now you have abandoned me, and you have been worshiping other gods. Therefore, I will not rescue you again and again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG10_14" data-id="JG10_14">You have chosen those gods to be the ones you worship. So ask them to help you. Let them be the ones who rescue you when you are in trouble!"</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG10_16" data-id="JG10_16">Then the Israelites threw away the idols of the foreign gods they had cherished, and they worshiped Yahweh. He saw that they were suffering very much, and he reached the limit of his endurance over the misery of Israel.</span>
