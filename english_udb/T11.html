<span class="v-num v-1-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">1-2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_1-2" data-id="T11_1-2">I, Paul, am writing this letter to you, Timothy. You are like a son to me, for you believe the same things about God as I do. God who commanded me to be an apostle is God our Savior and the Messiah Jesus in whom we have confidence for the future. May God the Father and the Messiah Jesus our Lord be kind to you, have mercy upon you, and give you peace.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_3" data-id="T11_3">I urge you now, just like I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, that you remain in Ephesus so that you might command certain men not to teach false doctrines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_4" data-id="T11_4">And command them not to listen to old useless stories and endless lists of ancestors, which only cause people to argue with each other. But those things do not promote God's planâ€”that happens when we believe God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_5" data-id="T11_5">And the reason that we command people to do these things is so that they will love from a pure heart, and from a good conscience, and from faith that is sincere.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_6" data-id="T11_6">Some people have stopped doing these good things; instead, they are now saying useless things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_7" data-id="T11_7">They want to teach about the law God gave to Moses, but they do not understand what they are saying, nor the things about which they say with confidence.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_8" data-id="T11_8">But we know that law God gave to Moses is good if someone uses it in the right way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_9" data-id="T11_9">We know that God did not give the law to Moses to control a good person, but to control people who act as though there are no laws and who refuse to obey anyone, those who sin and do not honor God, those who do not revere God and who sin, those who refuse to perform rituals that please God and who show no respect for religion, and those who murder their fathers and mothers and other people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_10" data-id="T11_10">God gave it to control homosexuals and people who who are sexually immoral, those who kidnap people and sell them as slaves, Those who are liars and false witnesses in courts of law, and to stop every other action that is contrary to our true teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_11" data-id="T11_11">All of this agrees with the wonderful good news that God, whom we praise, gave to me to announce to others.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_12" data-id="T11_12">I am grateful to the Messiah Jesus our Lord who enabled me to do this work, because he considered that I could be trusted. So he appointed me in order that I would serve him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_13" data-id="T11_13">Formerly I said evil things about him, I caused his people to suffer, and I acted very cruelly toward them. But the Messiah acted kindly to me since I did not know that I was doing because I did not believe in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_14" data-id="T11_14">Our Lord kindly did very much for me that I did not deserve, so that I now believe in the Messiah Jesus and I love him because I belong to him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_15" data-id="T11_15">Everyone should completely accept this fact, because we know that it is true: Jesus the Messiah came into the world to save sinful people so that God would not punish them for their sins. As for me, I consider that I have sinned more than all others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_16" data-id="T11_16">Yet the Messiah Jesus acted mercifully to me who has sinned worse than all the others in order that he might demonstrate to people that he is perfectly patient with them. He wanted what he did for me to be an example to people who would later believe in him and as a result would live forever.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_17" data-id="T11_17">No one can see the eternal king, and he cannot die. He alone is God. Everyone should honor and praise forever and ever. Amen.</span>
