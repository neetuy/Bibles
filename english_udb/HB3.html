<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_1" data-id="HB3_1">My fellow believers, God has set you apart and has chosen you to belong to himself. So consider Jesus. He is God's apostle to us and is also the high priest whom we say we believe in together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_2" data-id="HB3_2">He faithfully served God, who appointed him, just like Moses faithfully served all of God's people, whom we call God's house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">3-4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_3-4" data-id="HB3_3-4">Now just as every house is made by someone, God made everything. So God has considered that Jesus is worthy for people to honor him more than they honor Moses, just as the one who builds a house deserves for people to honor him more than they should honor the house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_5" data-id="HB3_5">Moses very faithfully served God as he helped all of God's people, just as a servant faithfully serves his master. So Moses testified about what Jesus would say later.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_6" data-id="HB3_6">But the Messiah is the Son who rules over God's people, and we are the people he rules if we continue to courageously believe in the Messiah and confidently expect God to do all that he has promised to do for us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_7" data-id="HB3_7">The Holy Spirit caused the psalmist to write these words in the scriptures to the Israelites:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB3_7" data-id="HB3_7">"Now, when you hear God speak to you,</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_8" data-id="HB3_8">do not refuse to obey him, and do not let your desires be more important that what God says, for if you do, you would be just like your ancestors long ago, when they turned away from God and did not obey him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_9" data-id="HB3_9">Your ancestors repeatedly tested me, to see whether I would be patient with them, even though for forty years they saw all the amazing things I did.</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_10" data-id="HB3_10">So I became angry with those people, and I said about them, 'They are never faithful to me, and they do not understand how I wanted them to conduct their lives.'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_11" data-id="HB3_11">I was angry with them and solemnly declared, 'They will not enter the land of Canaan where I would let them rest!'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_12" data-id="HB3_12">So, fellow believers, be careful that none of you stops trusting in the Messiah because of evil in your heart, which would cause you to reject the only God who actually lives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_13" data-id="HB3_13">Instead, each of you must encourage each other every day, while you still have the opportunity. If you are stubborn, others will deceive you and lead you to sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_14" data-id="HB3_14">We are now joined to the Messiah if we continue to seriously and confidently trust in him, from the time we first trusted in him to the time when we die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_15" data-id="HB3_15">The psalmist wrote in the scripture that God said,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB3_15" data-id="HB3_15">"Now, when you hear me speaking to you, do not stubbornly disobey me as your ancestors did when they rebelled against me."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_16" data-id="HB3_16">Remember who it was who rebelled against God, even though they heard him speak to them. It was all of God's people who Moses led out of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_17" data-id="HB3_17">And remember who it was with whom God was disgusted for forty years. It was God's people who sinned, and their dead bodies lay there in the desert.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_18" data-id="HB3_18">And remember about whom God solemnly declared, "They will not enter the land where I would let them rest." It was those Israelites who disobeyed God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_19" data-id="HB3_19">So, from that example we know that it was because they did not keep trusting in God that they were unable to enter the land where God would allow them to rest.</span>
