<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_1" data-id="EK47_1">Then in the vision, the man brought me back to the entrance of the temple. There I saw water coming out from under the entrance and flowing toward the east. The water was flowing down the south side of the entrance, to the right of the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_2" data-id="EK47_2">Then he brought me out through the north gate and led me around to the eastern gate at its exterior side.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_3" data-id="EK47_3">As the man continued walking toward the east, I saw that he had a measuring line in his hand. He measured off 540 meters and then led me through water that covered my ankles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_4" data-id="EK47_4">Then he measured off another 540 meters and led me through water that was up to my knees. Then he measured off another 540 meters and led me through water that was up to my waist.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_5" data-id="EK47_5">Then he measured off another 540 meters and led me through water that was now a river that I could not cross, because the water was so deep; to continue farther would have required me to swim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_6" data-id="EK47_6">Then he asked me, "Son of man, think about this carefully." Then he led me onto the bank of the river</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_7" data-id="EK47_7">and back along it toward in the direction from where we had come. There I saw many trees growing on each side of the river.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_8" data-id="EK47_8">He said to me, "This water flows east and goes down into the Dead Sea. And when the water enters the Dead Sea, it stays fresh and restores the water of the Sea and makes it fresh again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_9" data-id="EK47_9">Swarms of fish will live in the water wherever the river flows. There will be many fish in the Dead Sea, because the water that flows into it will cause the salt water to become fresh water. Wherever the river flows, everything alongside it will flourish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_10" data-id="EK47_10">Fishermen will stand along the riverbank to catch fish. From En Gedi on the western side to En Eglaim there will be places to spread fishing nets. There will be many kinds of fish, as there are in the Great Sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_11" data-id="EK47_11">But the swamps and marshes along the shore will not become fresh; they will be left to make salt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_12" data-id="EK47_12">Many kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and they will always have fruit. They will bear new fruit every month, because the water that comes from the temple flows continually to the trees. Their fruit will be good to eat and their leaves will be good for healing."</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_13" data-id="EK47_13">In the vision, Yahweh also said this to me: "Here is a list of the twelve tribes of Israel and the territory that each tribe is to receive. The descendants of Joseph will receive two portions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_14" data-id="EK47_14">Divide the land equally among all of the tribes. I lifted up my hand to swear to your ancestors that I would give them this land to own permanently.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_15" data-id="EK47_15">These will be the boundaries of the land:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EK47_15" data-id="EK47_15">On the north side, it will extend from the Mediterranean Sea east along the road to Hethlon, and then on to Zedad,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_16" data-id="EK47_16">to Berothah, and then on to Sibraim, which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath. The boundary will run as far as Hazer Hattikon, which is on the border of the region of Hauran.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_17" data-id="EK47_17">So the boundary will extend from the Mediterranean Sea to Hazar Enan on the border between Hamath to the north and Damascus to the south. That will be the northern boundary.</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_18" data-id="EK47_18">On the east side, the boundary will extend between Hauran and Damascus, south along the Jordan River between the region of Gilead and the territory of Israel, along the Dead Sea as far as Tamar. That will be the eastern boundary.</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_19" data-id="EK47_19">On the south side, the boundary will extend from Tamar to the springs near Meribah Kadesh. Then it will extend west along the brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. That will be the southern boundary.</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_20" data-id="EK47_20">On the west side, the boundary will be the Mediterranean Sea, north to a point near Lebo Hamath.</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_21" data-id="EK47_21">You must distribute this land among yourselves, among the tribes of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_22" data-id="EK47_22">You must assign the land as a permanent possession for yourselves and also for any foreigners who are living and raising their children among you. You must consider them to be like native born Israelites, and they must be assigned land among the tribes of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_23" data-id="EK47_23">Wherever foreigners are living, you must give them some land to belong to them permanently.' That is what the Lord Yahweh declares."</span>
