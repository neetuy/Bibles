<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM16_2" data-id="RM16_2">I request that you receive her because you are all joined to the Lord. You should do that because God's people ought to welcome their fellow believers. I am also requesting that you help her by giving her whatever she needs, because she has helped many people, including me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM16_3" data-id="RM16_3">Tell Priscilla and her husband Aquila that I send greetings to them. They worked with me for the Messiah Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM16_4" data-id="RM16_4">and they were even willing to die for me. I thank them, and the non-Jewish congregations also thank them for saving my life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM16_5" data-id="RM16_5">Also tell the congregation that meets in their house that I send my greetings to them.

<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM16_18" data-id="RM16_18">They do not serve our Lord the Messiah! On the contrary, they only want to satisfy their own desires. They deceive the people using smooth talk and praise so the people do not realize that these troublemakers are teaching false things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM16_19" data-id="RM16_19">Believers everywhere know that you have obeyed what the Messiah says in the good news.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM16_25" data-id="RM16_25">Now to God, the one who is able to strengthen you spiritually by my proclamation of the good news of Jesus the Messiah that God did not reveal in any age before our own time —</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM16_26" data-id="RM16_26">but now God has made it known by means of what the scriptures said would happen — so that people in all the people groups in the world may believe in the Messiah and obey him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM16_27" data-id="RM16_27">May God, who alone is wise, be praised forever, because of what Jesus the Messiah has done for us. May it be so! </span>
