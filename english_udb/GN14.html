<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN14_8" data-id="GN14_8">Then the armies of the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboyim and Bela marched out to fight the armies of the four kings in Siddim Valley.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN14_10" data-id="GN14_10">TheValley of Siddim was full of tar pits. So when the armies of the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah tried to run away, many of the men fell into these pits. The others escaped and ran away to the hills.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN14_11" data-id="GN14_11">As they fled, their enemies seized all of the valuable things in Sodom and Gomorrah, including all the food.</span>

Abram had made an agreement with Mamre and his two brothers, Eshcol and Aner, that they would help each other if there was a war. One of the men who escaped from the battle told Abram the Hebrew what had happened and that the enemy had captured his nephew, Lot, and taken him away. So Abram summoned 318 men who were his servants, men who had been with Abram since they were born and who knew how to fight as warriors. They all went together and pursued their enemies as far as the city of Dan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN14_15" data-id="GN14_15">During the night, Abram divided the men into several groups, and they attacked their enemies from various directions and defeated them.

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN14_19" data-id="GN14_19">Then he blessed Abram and said, "I ask the supreme God, the one who created heaven and earth, to bless you.</span>
