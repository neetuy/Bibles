<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_1" data-id="JN7_1">After this, Jesus went to other areas in the region of Galilee. He avoided traveling to Judea because the Jewish authorities were searching for a way to charge him with a crime and to have him put to death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_2" data-id="JN7_2">Now it was time for the Jewish Festival of Shelters. This was a time to remember when the Jewish people lived in tents during the Exodus long ago.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_3" data-id="JN7_3">Because the festival was to take place in Judea, Jesus' brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea so your other followers can see the powerful works you can do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_4" data-id="JN7_4">No one hides his work if he wants people to know what kind of a person he is. Show yourself to the world!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_5" data-id="JN7_5">For not even his own brothers trusted in him or thought he was telling the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_6" data-id="JN7_6">So Jesus said to them, "It is not yet time for me to bring my work to an end. However, you can choose any time you want to accomplish whatever you wish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_7" data-id="JN7_7">The people who live for themselves and love the things of this world cannot hate you, but they do hate me. I am the one who tells them that what they do with their lives is evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_8" data-id="JN7_8">You go ahead to the festival. I am not going up now; it is not the right time for me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_9" data-id="JN7_9">After he said that, Jesus stayed a little longer in Galilee.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_10" data-id="JN7_10">However, a few days after his brothers left for the festival, he also went, but he did so secretly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_11" data-id="JN7_11">The Jewish opponents of Jesus were looking for him, hoping to find him at the festival. They were asking people, "Where is Jesus? Is he here?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_12" data-id="JN7_12">Among the crowds, many people were quietly speaking with each other about Jesus. Some were saying, "He is a good man!" Others were saying instead, "No! He is deceiving and misleading the crowds!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_13" data-id="JN7_13">Because they were afraid of the Jewish enemies of Jesus, no one spoke of him in a public place where other people could overhear what they were saying.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_14" data-id="JN7_14">When the Festival of Shelters was about half over, Jesus went to the temple courtyard and started to teach there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_15" data-id="JN7_15">The Jews were amazed at what he was saying. They said, "This man never studied our doctrines with an approved instructor; he never enrolled in our schools! How does he know so much?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_16" data-id="JN7_16">Jesus replied to them, "What I teach does not come from myself. It comes from the one who sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_17" data-id="JN7_17">If anyone chooses to do what God wants, he will find out if what I teach comes from God or if I speak only by my own authority.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_18" data-id="JN7_18">Anyone who speaks on his own authority speaks so others will honor only him. However, if a servant works hard to honor the person who sent him, to give him a good reputation as a man of integrity, there is no fault in that kind of a servant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_19" data-id="JN7_19">Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you does what the law demands. You are the ones plotting to murder me right now!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_20" data-id="JN7_20">Someone in the crowd answered, "You have a demon! Name the person who wants to put you to death!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_21" data-id="JN7_21">Jesus replied to the crowd, "Because I did one work of power for you to see, you all marvel at it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_22" data-id="JN7_22">Moses gave you a law, and that law says you must circumcise your male children and that you must do that exactly seven days after the children are born. (To be accurate, this rite was from your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and not from Moses, who wrote down the law about this practice.) Because of that requirement in the law, you sometimes have to circumcise a baby on the Sabbath day, and that is working, too!</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_23" data-id="JN7_23">You sometimes circumcise boys on the Sabbath so that you will not violate the law of Moses. So why are you angry with me, saying I worked on the Sabbath when I was healing a man! Healing someone is more wonderful, and it is a greater work than circumcising a baby!</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_24" data-id="JN7_24">Stop deciding whether healing this man was right or wrong according to a false application of God's law, and that without any thought! Instead, decide what a person should do and how he should be judged by the principle of what is right and what is just according to God, not man."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_25" data-id="JN7_25">Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, "Is this not the man they are trying to put to death?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_26" data-id="JN7_26">He is saying these things publicly, but the authorities are not saying anything to oppose him. Is that because they know he is the Messiah?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_27" data-id="JN7_27">But this cannot be the Messiah! We know where this man came from, but when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_28" data-id="JN7_28">So while Jesus was teaching in the temple courtyard, he called out as he taught, "Yes, you say you know me, and you think you know where I am from. But I have come here not because I appointed myself. Instead, the one who sent me bears the truth as his testimony, and you do not know him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_29" data-id="JN7_29">I know him because I have come from him. He is the one who sent me."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_30" data-id="JN7_30">Then they tried to lay their hands on him, but no one could arrest him because it was not yet the time for him to complete his work and for his life to end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_31" data-id="JN7_31">Many in the crowd, after they heard him and saw his works, put their trust in him. They said, "When the Messiah comes, will he be able to do more miraculous signs than this man has done?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_32" data-id="JN7_32">The Pharisees heard them quietly speaking these things about Jesus. So they, the chief priests and Pharisees together sent some officers to arrest him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_33" data-id="JN7_33">Then Jesus said, "I will be with you for a only a short time. Then I am going back to the one who sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_34" data-id="JN7_34">You will search for me, but you will not find me. Where I am going, you cannot come."</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_35" data-id="JN7_35">So the Jewish people who were his enemies said to themselves, "Where can this man go where we cannot find him? Does he intend to go where the Jews are spread all across the Greek world, and will he teach the people there these new things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_36" data-id="JN7_36">What did he mean when he said, 'You will search for me, but you will not be able to find me,' and when he said, 'Where I am going, you cannot come?'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_37" data-id="JN7_37">So on the last day of the festival, the great day, Jesus stood up cried out with a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_38" data-id="JN7_38">Whoever trusts in me, as the scripture said, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_39" data-id="JN7_39">He said this about the Spirit, whom the Father was going to give to those who trusted in him. God had not yet sent the Spirit to live within those who trusted him because Jesus had not yet finished his work, that work which would bring great honor to God by saving his people through his death.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_40" data-id="JN7_40">When some of the crowd heard those words, they said, "This truly is the Prophet that we were expecting."</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_41" data-id="JN7_41">Others said, "The Messiah cannot come from Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_42" data-id="JN7_42">Do not the scriptures say that Messiah must come through the descendants of David and that he must be born in Bethlehem, the village that was David's home?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_43" data-id="JN7_43">So there was a division of opinion about Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_44" data-id="JN7_44">Some of the people wanted to arrest him. Yet no one laid a hand on him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_45" data-id="JN7_45">So the officers returned to the chief priests and the Pharisees. These were the officers that the rulers had sent to arrest Jesus. The Pharisees said to the officers, "Why did you not seize him and bring him here?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_46" data-id="JN7_46">The officers replied, "No one ever spoke like this man."</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_47" data-id="JN7_47">Then the Pharisees replied, "Have you been deceived, too?</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_48" data-id="JN7_48">None of the Jewish authorities or the Pharisees have trusted in Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_49" data-id="JN7_49">This crowd who does not know the teachings of our laws, let them be cursed!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_50" data-id="JN7_50">Then Nicodemus spoke. (He was the one who had gone to see Jesus at night to speak with him, and he was one of the Pharisees.) He said to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_51" data-id="JN7_51">"Our Jewish law does not permit us to condemn a man before we have listened to him. First, we give him a hearing, and we must learn about what he has done."</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_52" data-id="JN7_52">They replied to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search carefully and read what is written in the scriptures! You will find that no prophet comes from Galilee."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_53" data-id="JN7_53">[Then they all left and went to their own homes.</span>
