She must not touch anything that is sacred, that belongs to me only, or enter the area of the sacred tent, until that time is ended.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV12_5" data-id="LV12_5">If a woman gives birth to a baby girl, she must be avoided for two weeks, as she must be avoided when she is menstruating each month.

<span class="v LV12_7" data-id="LV12_7">Those are the regulations for women who give birth to a baby boy or girl.</span>

One will be burned completely on the altar, and one will be an offering to enable her to become acceptable to God again. By doing that, the priest will cause her to be forgiven for any sins she has committed, and she no longer will need to be avoided."</span>
