<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_1" data-id="C213_1">This is the third time I am coming to you to deal with these matters. The principle in dealing with these issues is what the scripture says: "Every accusation against another must be based on the testimony of two or three persons," not just one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_2" data-id="C213_2">When I was there on the second visit I said to those who had sinned and who had been charged before the church, and to the entire church, and I will say it again: I will not overlook these charges.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_3" data-id="C213_3">I tell you this because you are looking for proof that the Messiah is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you; instead, he is working in you by his great power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_4" data-id="C213_4">We learn from the Messiah's example, because they crucified him when he was weak, yet God has made him alive again. And we, too, are weak as we live and follow his example, but with him, God will strengthen us as we talk with you about these sins that some of you have committed.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_5" data-id="C213_5">It is yourselves whom you must examine and see how you live. You must look for evidence that you trust in how God loves you and has mercy on you. It is you whom you must put yourself to the test and ask if Jesus the Messiah lives within you? He lives in every one of you, unless, of course, you fail this test.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_6" data-id="C213_6">And I hope that you will find that we pass the test and the Messiah lives in us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_7" data-id="C213_7">Now we pray to God that you may not do anything that is wrong. We pray for this, not because we want to seem better than you by passing that test. Instead, we want you to know and do the right things. Even if we seem to have failed, we want you to succeed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_8" data-id="C213_8">The truth controls what we do; we cannot do anything against the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_9" data-id="C213_9">We have joy when we are weak and you are strong. We pray that you may always trust and obey God completely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_10" data-id="C213_10">I am away from you now as I write this to you. When I come to you, I do not have to deal harshly with you. Because the Lord made me an apostle, I prefer to encourage you and not to make you weaker.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_11" data-id="C213_11">The last thing, brothers and sisters, is this: Rejoice! Act and behave better than you have been acting, and allow the Lord to give you courage. Agree with each other and live in peace together. If you do these things, God, who loves you and brings you peace, will be with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_12" data-id="C213_12">Welcome each other in a way that tells everybody how much you love each other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_13" data-id="C213_13">All of us here, whom God has set apart for himself, greet you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_14" data-id="C213_14">May the Lord Jesus the Messiah act kindly toward you, may God love you, and may the Holy Spirit be with you all. </span>
