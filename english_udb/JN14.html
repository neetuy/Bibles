He will teach you everything that you need to know. He will also cause you to remember all the things that I have told you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_27" data-id="JN14_27">As I leave you with peace, it is my peace that I am giving to you.
