<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_1" data-id="JG13_1">Again the Israelite people did evil, and Yahweh saw what they had done. So Yahweh helped the Philistines to conquer them. They ruled over the Israelites for forty years.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_2" data-id="JG13_2">There was a man named Manoah from the family of Dan who lived in the town of Zorah. His wife was unable to become pregnant, and so she had not given birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_3" data-id="JG13_3">One day, the angel of Yahweh appeared to Manoah's wife and said to her, "Even though you have not been able to give birth to any children until now, you will soon become pregnant and you will give birth to a son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_4" data-id="JG13_4">From now until he is born, you must not drink any wine or other alcoholic drink, and you must not eat any food that the law says we should not eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_5" data-id="JG13_5">You will become pregnant. After you give birth to your son, no one may ever cut his hair. He will be dedicated to God even before he is born until the day he dies. He will begin the work that will rescue Israel from the power of the Philistines."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_6" data-id="JG13_6">The woman ran and told her husband, "A man whom God sent came to me. I was very afraid of him, because he was like an angel from God. I did not ask where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_7" data-id="JG13_7">But he told me, 'You have become pregnant, and you will give birth to a son. Until then, you must not drink any wine or any alcoholic drink, and you must not eat any food that God's law says you are not to eat. Your son will be a Nazirite; that is one who is dedicated to God before he is born and until the day he dies.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_8" data-id="JG13_8">Then Manoah prayed to Yahweh, saying, "O Lord, I plead with you, allow that man whom you sent to us to come again and teach us how we should raise the boy who will be born to us."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_9" data-id="JG13_9">God did what Manoah asked, and his angel came to the woman again. This time she was out in the field. But again her husband Manoah was not with her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_10" data-id="JG13_10">So she quickly ran and said to her husband, "The man who appeared to me a few days ago has come back again!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_11" data-id="JG13_11">Manoah ran back with his wife and asked him, "Are you the man who talked with my wife a few days ago?" He replied, "Yes I am."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_12" data-id="JG13_12">Manoah asked him, "When what you promised occurs and my wife gives birth to a son, what rules will there be for the child, and what work will he do when he grows up?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_13" data-id="JG13_13">Yahweh's angel replied, "Your wife must obey all the instructions I gave her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_14" data-id="JG13_14">Before the baby is born, she must not eat grapes, drink wine or any other alcoholic drink, or eat anything that the law says we should not eat."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_15" data-id="JG13_15">Then Manoah said, "Please stay here until we can kill and cook a young goat for you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_16" data-id="JG13_16">Yahweh's angel replied, "I will stay here, but I will not eat anything. However, you may kill an animal and sacrifice it as a burned offering to Yahweh." But Manoah did not yet realize that this was Yahweh's angel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_17" data-id="JG13_17">Then Manoah asked him, "What is your name? When what you have promised happens, we want to honor you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_18" data-id="JG13_18">Yahweh's angel replied, "Why do you ask me my name? It is too marvelous."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_19" data-id="JG13_19">Then Manoah killed a young goat and burned it on a rock, along with a grain offering, as a sacrifice to Yahweh. Then he did an amazing thing as Manoah and his wife watched.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_20" data-id="JG13_20">When the flames went up from the altar toward the sky, Yahweh's angel went up in the flame from the altar. Manoah and his wife saw that and lay facedown on the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_21" data-id="JG13_21">Although Yahweh's angel did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized who this person really was.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_22" data-id="JG13_22">So Manoah said, "Now we are sure to die, because we have seen God!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_23" data-id="JG13_23">But his wife said, "No, I do not think so. If Yahweh intended to kill us, he would not have accepted the burned offering and the grain offering. And he would not have appeared to us and told us the wonderful thing that would happen to us, and he would not have performed this miracle."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_24" data-id="JG13_24">When their son was born, they named him Samson. Yahweh blessed him as he grew up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_25" data-id="JG13_25">While he was in Mahanehdan, which is between the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol, Yahweh's Spirit began to control him.</span>
