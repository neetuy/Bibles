<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK24_18" data-id="EK24_18">So one morning I talked to the people as usual, and that evening my wife suddenly died. The next morning I did what Yahweh had told me to do.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK24_19" data-id="EK24_19">Then the people asked me, "What do the things that you are doing signify to us?"</span>

<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK24_24" data-id="EK24_24">Ezekiel will be a warning to you, and you must do what he has done. When that happens, you will know that I, Yahweh the Lord have the power to do what I say that I will do.'"</span>
