<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_3" data-id="NU18_3">But while they do that work, they must not go near the sacred items inside the tent or near the altar. If they do that, they will die, and you will die, too!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_4" data-id="NU18_4">They may assist you in doing all the work to take care of the sacred tent, but no one else is permitted to come near the place where you are working.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_5" data-id="NU18_5">You are the ones who will do the sacred work inside the sacred tent and at the altar. If you obey these instructions, I will not become very angry with the Israelite people again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_6" data-id="NU18_6">I myself have chosen the descendants of Levi from the other Israelites in order that they may be your special helpers. They are like a gift that I have given you to work at the sacred tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_7" data-id="NU18_7">But it is you and your sons, who are the priests, who must perform all the details I have commanded concerning the altar and with what happens inside the Very Holy Place.

<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_9" data-id="NU18_9">The parts of the offerings that are not completely burned on the altar belong to you. Those parts of the sacred offerings, including the flour offerings, the offerings to make atonement for sins and to remove the guilt of sins, are set apart, and are to be given to you and your sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_10" data-id="NU18_10">You are to eat it as a most holy offering. Every male in your clan may eat it. But you must have respect for those offerings because they are holy to you.</span>

All of those offerings that the Israelites present to me belong to you and your sons and daughters. They will always be your share. All the members of your family who have performed the rituals to cause them to be acceptable to me are permitted to eat from these offerings.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_16" data-id="NU18_16">They must buy them back when they are one month old. The price that they must pay for each one is five pieces of silver. They must weigh the silver on the scales that are in the sacred tent.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_17" data-id="NU18_17">But they are not permitted to buy back the firstborn cattle or sheep or goats. They are holy and have been set apart for me. Slaughter them and sprinkle their blood on the altar. Then completely burn the fat of those animals on the altar to be an offering to me. The smell as they burn will be very pleasing to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_18" data-id="NU18_18">The meat from those offerings will be yours, just like the breast and right thigh of animals that are presented to me to restore fellowship with me, as the priest lifts them up high in front of the altar, are yours.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_19" data-id="NU18_19">Anything that the Israelite people present to me as holy gifts, I am giving to you.

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_21" data-id="NU18_21">When the Israelite people bring to me a tenth of all the crops and of their newborn animals, I will give that to you descendants of Levi. That will be your payment for the work you do at the sacred tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_22" data-id="NU18_22">The other Israelites must not go near that tent. If they go near it, I will consider that their doing that is a sin, and they will die for committing that sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_23" data-id="NU18_23">Only the descendants of Levi are permitted to work at the sacred tent, and they will be punished if anything bad happens to it. That is a law that will never be changed. You descendants of Levi will not receive any land to own among all the other Israelite people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_24" data-id="NU18_24">The Israelites must present one tenth of all their crops and animals as offerings to me, and that is what I give to the descendents of Levi so they can provide for themselves. This is why I said that I will not give the descendants of Levi any land to own.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_25" data-id="NU18_25">Yahweh said to Moses,</span>

<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_27" data-id="NU18_27">just like the other Israelites present one tenth of the grain and wine that they produce.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_28" data-id="NU18_28">You must present to me one tenth of all that you receive from the Israelite people. That will be your sacred offering to me. You must present it to Aaron.</span>

<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_30" data-id="NU18_30">Also, tell this to the descendants of Levi, 'When you present those best portions of grain and wine as your offering to me, I will consider that those gifts are as though they came from your own grain and wine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_31" data-id="NU18_31">You descendants of Levi and your families are permitted to eat the rest of that food, and you may eat it wherever you want to, because it is your payment for the work that you do at the sacred tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_32" data-id="NU18_32">If you give to the priests the best portions of what you receive, you will not be punished by me for accepting one tenth of the gifts that the people bring to me. But you must consider those gifts to be sacred. If you sin by eating those things in ways that are contrary to these regulations that I have given to you, you will be executed.'"</span>
