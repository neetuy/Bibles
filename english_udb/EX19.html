<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_2" data-id="EX19_2">After they left Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai, and they set up their tents at the base of the mountain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_3" data-id="EX19_3">Moses climbed up the mountain to talk with God. Yahweh called to him from the top of the mountain and said, "This is what I want you to say to the Israelite people, the descendants of Jacob,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_4" data-id="EX19_4">'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians. You have seen what I did for you and how I brought you as if you had been on eagles' wings here to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_5" data-id="EX19_5">So now, if you do what I tell you and obey all that I command you, you will be my own people. You will be my special possession from among all of the people, for all the earth is mine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_6" data-id="EX19_6">You will be people over whom I will rule, and you will be a kingdom where everyone will worship me like priests, and you will be a nation only for me.'

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_7" data-id="EX19_7">So Moses went down the mountain and called the elders of the people. He told them everything that Yahweh had told him to tell them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_8" data-id="EX19_8">The people all said, "We will do everything that Yahweh has told us to do." Then Moses climbed back up the mountain and reported to Yahweh what the people had said.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_9" data-id="EX19_9">Then Yahweh said to Moses "Listen carefully. I will come to you from inside a thick cloud. When I am speaking to you, the people will hear it, and they will always believe that you are their leader." Then Moses told Yahweh what the people said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_10" data-id="EX19_10">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go back down to the people again. Tell them to get ready for my coming. They must purify themselves today and tomorrow, and wash their clothes, too.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_11" data-id="EX19_11">They must do that to be ready on the third day. On that day I will come down to Mount Sinai to where all the people can see me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_12" data-id="EX19_12">You must make a boundary around the base of the mountain, and tell them, 'Be sure that you do not climb the mountain or even go near it.

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_13" data-id="EX19_13">Do not let anyone touch any person or any animal that touches the mountain.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_14" data-id="EX19_14">So Moses went down the mountain again and told the people to purify themselves and to get ready for Yahweh's coming. They did what Moses told them to do, and they also washed their clothes.</span>

A trumpet sounded very loudly, and the people in the camp shook because they were very afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_17" data-id="EX19_17">Then Moses led the people outside the camp to meet with God. They stood around the base of the mountain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_18" data-id="EX19_18">Then Yahweh descended on Mount Sinai so that the entire mountain was covered in smoke and surrounded by fire. The smoke rose up like the smoke from the chimney of a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_19" data-id="EX19_19">As the sound of the trumpet continued to become louder, Moses spoke to Yahweh, and Yahweh answered him in a loud voice that sounded like thunder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_20" data-id="EX19_20">Then Yahweh came down again onto the top of Mount Sinai, and he summoned Moses to come up to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX19_21" data-id="EX19_21">Yahweh said to Moses, "Go down again and warn the people not to cross the boundary in order to look at me. If they do that, many of them will die.</span>
