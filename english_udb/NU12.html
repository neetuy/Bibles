<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">1-2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_1-2" data-id="NU12_1-2">Moses' older sister Miriam and his older brother Aaron were jealous of Moses and said, "Is Moses the only one to whom Yahweh has spoken messages to tell to us? Does Yahweh not speak messages through us two also?" They also criticized Moses because he had married a woman who was a descendant of the Cush people group. And Yahweh heard Miriam and Aaron complaining about Moses.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_3" data-id="NU12_3">The truth was that Moses was a very humble person. He was more humble than anyone else on the earth.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_4" data-id="NU12_4">So immediately Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam. He said, "All three of you must go and stand at the sacred tent." So they did that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_5" data-id="NU12_5">Then Yahweh descended to the entrance of the tent in a cloud that resembled a huge white pillar. He told Aaron and Miriam to step forward, so they did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_6" data-id="NU12_6">Then he said to them,</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v NU12_6" data-id="NU12_6">"Listen to me!</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v NU12_6" data-id="NU12_6">When a prophet is among you,</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v NU12_6" data-id="NU12_6">I usually reveal myself to him by allowing him to see visions,</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v NU12_6" data-id="NU12_6">and I speak to him in dreams.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_7" data-id="NU12_7">But that is not the way I speak to my servant Moses.</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v NU12_7" data-id="NU12_7">I trust that he will lead my people well.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_8" data-id="NU12_8">So I talk to him face to face.</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v NU12_8" data-id="NU12_8">I speak to him clearly, not using parables.</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v NU12_8" data-id="NU12_8">He has even seen what I look like.</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v NU12_8" data-id="NU12_8">So you should be afraid to criticize my servant Moses!"</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_9" data-id="NU12_9">Yahweh was very angry with Miriam and Aaron, and he left.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_10" data-id="NU12_10">When the cloud rose up from the sacred tent, Aaron looked at Miriam, and he saw that her skin was as white as snow, because she now had leprosy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_11" data-id="NU12_11">Aaron said to Moses, "My master, please do not punish us for this sin that we have foolishly committed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_12" data-id="NU12_12">Do not allow Miriam to be like a baby that is already dead when it is born, whose flesh is already half decayed!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_13" data-id="NU12_13">So Moses cried out to Yahweh, saying, "God, I plead with you to heal her!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_14" data-id="NU12_14">But Yahweh replied, "If her father had rebuked her for doing something wrong by spitting in her face, she would have been ashamed for seven days. She should be ashamed because of what she has done. So send her outside the camp for seven days. Then she will not have leprosy anymore, and she may return to the camp."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_15" data-id="NU12_15">So they sent her outside the camp for seven days. The people did not move to another location until she returned.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU12_16" data-id="NU12_16">But after she returned, they left Hazeroth and moved north in the Paran Desert and set up their tents there.</span>
