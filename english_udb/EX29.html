<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX29_43" data-id="EX29_43">That is where I will meet with the Israelite people, and the brilliant light of my presence will cause that place to be holy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX29_44" data-id="EX29_44">I will dedicate the sacred tent and the altar. I will also dedicate Aaron and his sons to serve me by being priests.</span>
