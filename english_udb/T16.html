<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_1" data-id="T16_1">As for believers who are slaves, they should honor their masters in every way, so that people will not insult God or what we teach.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_2" data-id="T16_2">Slaves who have masters who believe in the Messiah should not be disrespectful to them, for they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve their masters even better, because their masters believer in the Messiah, and God loves them. Teach these things and urge people that they do them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_3" data-id="T16_3">If anyone teaches false doctrines, and does not accept the reliable teaching about our Lord Jesus the Messiah nor accept the  teaching about how to conduct our lives in a manner that pleases God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_4" data-id="T16_4">that person is very proud and does not understand anything. Instead, they abnormally desire to argue about unimportant matters and about certain words. People who listen to these things envy others. They quarrel with others, say bad things about others, and suspect that others have evil motives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_5" data-id="T16_5">They constantly quarrel with people because their whole way of thinking has become completely wrong, and because they have rejected true teaching. As a result, they make the mistake of thinking that they will get a lot of money by doing religious things.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_6" data-id="T16_6">But we do gain great benefit when we behave in a way that honors God and when we are content with what we have.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_7" data-id="T16_7">Indeed, we brought nothing into the world when we were born, and we are not able to take anything out of it when we die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_8" data-id="T16_8">So if we have food and clothing, we should be satisfied with these.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_9" data-id="T16_9">But some people strongly desire to be rich. As a result, they do wrong things to get money, and this will cause them to be caught as animals get caught in traps. They foolishly desire many things that will hurt them. God will completely destroy those people!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_10" data-id="T16_10">People do all sorts of evil things when they strongly desire to have a lot of money. Some people who longed for money have stopped believing the truth that all of us believe and they have caused themselves to be very sorrowful.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_11" data-id="T16_11">But you, the man who serves God, keep completely away from such love of money. Instead, decide that you will do what is right, and that you will honor God. Trust God, and love others. Endure difficult circumstances. Always be gentle with people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_12" data-id="T16_12">Try with all your energy to live according to what you believe. Remember that God chose you to take hold of this great gift of eternal life, and you made a good confession about that when you stood before many people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_13" data-id="T16_13">God, who gives life to all things, knows everything that you do. The Messiah Jesus also knows everything that you do. He strongly declared what was true when he was on trial before Pontius Pilate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_14" data-id="T16_14">I command you to hold tightly on to what the Messiah has commanded us without doing anything wrong so that no one can criticize you. Keep obeying the teaching until our Lord Jesus the Messiah comes again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_15" data-id="T16_15">Remember that God will cause Jesus to come again at the proper time. He is awesome and is the only Ruler! He reigns over all other kings and rules over all other people who rule!</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_16" data-id="T16_16">He is the only one who will never die, and he lives in heaven in light that is so bright that no one can approach it! He is the one whom no person has ever seen and whom no person is able to see! My desire is that all people will honor him and that he will rule powerfully forever! May it be so!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_17" data-id="T16_17">Tell the believers who are rich here in this present world that they should not be proud, and that they should not trust in their many possessions, because they cannot be certain how long they will have them. Instead, they should trust in God. He is the one who abundantly gives us everything we have in order that we may enjoy it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_18" data-id="T16_18">Also, tell them to do good things. They should desire to have many good works instead of a lot of money. Indeed, they should be generous with their possessions and be willing to share what they have with others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_19" data-id="T16_19">If they do that, it will be as though they were storing up for themselves many good things in heaven. In the future,  God will give them the life that is the real life.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v T16_19" data-id="T16_19"> 20 Timothy, protect the true message that God has given to you. Avoid people who want to chatter about things that are not important to God. Avoid also people who claim that they have true knowledge but who say things that oppose the true things we teach. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_21" data-id="T16_21">Certain men teach these things and so they have stopped believing what we believe. May God be kind to you all. </span>
