<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_1" data-id="JR52_1">Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became the king of Judah. He ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of a man named Jeremiah from Libnah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_2" data-id="JR52_2">Zedekiah did many things that Yahweh says are evil, like his father Jehoiakim had done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_3" data-id="JR52_3">The events described here happened because Yahweh was angry with the people of Jerusalem and of other places in Judah, and finally he exiled them and said that he did not want to have anything to do with them anymore.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JR52_3" data-id="JR52_3">Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_4" data-id="JR52_4">So, on the tenth day of the tenth month, when Zedekiah had been ruling for almost nine years, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon led his entire army to attack Jerusalem. They surrounded the city and built dirt ramps up to the top of the city walls to enable them to attack the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_5" data-id="JR52_5">They continued to surround Jerusalem until Zedekiah had been ruling for almost eleven years.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_6" data-id="JR52_6">When Zedekiah had been ruling for almost eleven years, on the ninth day of the fourth month of that year, the famine in the city had become very severe, and there was no more food for the people to eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_7" data-id="JR52_7">Then the soldiers of Babylonia broke through a section of the city wall, and all the Israelite soldiers fled. But because the city was surrounded by soldiers from Babylonia, Zedekiah and the Israelite soldiers waited until it became dark. Then they left the city through the gate between the two walls behind the king's garden. Then they ran toward the plain along the Jordan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_8" data-id="JR52_8">But the soldiers of Babylonia pursued King Zedekiah, and they caught up with him on the plains near Jericho. He was alone because all his men had all deserted him and had scattered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_9" data-id="JR52_9">The soldiers of Babylonia took him to the king of Babylon, who was at Riblah in the region of Hamath. There the king of Babylon told his soldiers what they should do to punish Zedekiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_10" data-id="JR52_10">They forced Zedekiah to watch while they killed his sons and all the officials from Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_11" data-id="JR52_11">Then they gouged out Zedekiah's eyes. They fastened him with bronze chains and took him to Babylon. They put him in a prison, and he remained there until the day that he died.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_12" data-id="JR52_12">On the tenth day of the fifth month of that year, which was when King Nebuchadnezzar had been ruling for almost nineteen years, Nebuzaradan, who was the captain of the king's bodyguards and one of the king's officials, arrived in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_13" data-id="JR52_13">He commanded his soldiers to burn down the temple of Yahweh, the king's palace, and all the houses in Jerusalem. They also destroyed all the important buildings in the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_14" data-id="JR52_14">Then he supervised the soldiers from Babylonia while they tore down the walls on all sides of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_15" data-id="JR52_15">Then Nebuzaradan forced to go to Babylon some of the poorest people, those Israelites who had said they would support the king of Babylon, the rest of the craftsmen, and other people who had remained in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_16" data-id="JR52_16">But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the very poor people to remain in Judah to take care of the vineyards and fields.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_17" data-id="JR52_17">The soldiers from Babylonia broke into pieces the huge bronze pillars that were in front of the temple, and the large bronze water tank called "The Sea," and the ten bronze water carts, and they took all the bronze to Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_18" data-id="JR52_18">They also took away the basins for holding the ashes from the burned sacrifices, the shovels for cleaning out the ashes, the tools for snuffing out the wicks of the lamps, the basins for holding the blood of the sacrificed animals, the dishes for incense, and all the other bronze items that were used when they made sacrifices at the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_19" data-id="JR52_19">Nebuzaradan also told his soldiers to take away the small bowls, the dishes for burning incense, the basins, pots, lampstands, bowls for incense, and the bowls used for pouring out the wine offerings. They took all the other items that were made of pure gold or silver.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_20" data-id="JR52_20">The bronze from the two pillars, the large water tank called "The Sea" and the twelve statues of oxen that were beneath it, and the water carts, was more than they could weigh. Those things had been made for the temple during the time that Solomon was the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_21" data-id="JR52_21">Each of the pillars was 27 feet tall and 18 feet around. They were hollow, and each had sides that were 3 inches thick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_22" data-id="JR52_22">The bronze head on the top of each pillar was seven and one-half feet high and was decorated all around with a bronze network of figures that represented pomegranates.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_23" data-id="JR52_23">There was a total of one hundred figures of pomegranates on the network at the top, 96 of which could be seen from the ground.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_24" data-id="JR52_24">When Nebuzaradan returned to Babylon, he took with him as prisoners Seraiah the high priest, Zephaniah who was Seraiah's deputy, and the three men who guarded the entrances to the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_25" data-id="JR52_25">He found some other people who were hiding in the city. So from them he took a commander of the army of Judah, seven of the king's advisors, the army commander's chief secretary who was in charge of recruiting soldiers for the army, and sixty other soldiers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_26" data-id="JR52_26">Nebuzaradan took them all to the king of Babylon, who was still at Riblah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_27" data-id="JR52_27">There at Riblah in the Hamath region, the king of Babylon commanded that they all be executed.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JR52_27" data-id="JR52_27">Many of the people of Judah were forced to leave their own land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_28" data-id="JR52_28">The number of people who were captured and sent to Babylon at that time, when Nebuchadnezzar had been ruling for almost seven years, was 3,023.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR52_29" data-id="JR52_29">Then, when he had been ruling for almost eighteen years, his soldiers took 832 more from Jerusalem to Babylonia.</span>
