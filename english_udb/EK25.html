<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_2" data-id="EK25_2">"Son of man, turn toward where the Ammon people group lives, and prophesy about the terrible things that will happen to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_3" data-id="EK25_3">Say about them, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: You shouted joyfully when my temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, and when the country of Israel was ruined, and when the people of Judah were exiled to Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_4" data-id="EK25_4">Therefore, I am going to allow an army of the people in the east to come and conquer you. They will set up their tents in your country and live there. They will eat the fruit from your fruit trees and drink the milk from your cattle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_5" data-id="EK25_5">I will cause your capital city of Rabbah to become a pasture for camels, and the rest of Ammon, where your people are now living, to become only a resting place for sheep.

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_6" data-id="EK25_6">This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: You clapped your hands joyfully and stomped your feet, and laughed because you despised the people in the land of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_7" data-id="EK25_7">Therefore, I will use my power against you, and I will enable other nations to conquer you and take you away like any other possessions of yours. I will destroy you completely, and you will no longer be one of the nations. When that happens, people will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.'"</span>

<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_8" data-id="EK25_8">This is also what the Lord Yahweh says: The people of Moab south of Ammon and the people of Seir south of Moab despised Israel and said, "The people of Israel have become as unimportant as all the other nations!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_9" data-id="EK25_9">Therefore I will destroy the cities that protect the borders of Moab, starting at Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim, the finest cities in Moab.</span>
