<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC2_3" data-id="ZC2_3">Then the angel who had been talking to me started to leave, and another angel walked toward him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC2_4" data-id="ZC2_4">The second angel said to him, "Run and tell that young man with the surveyor's line: Some day there will be very many people and livestock in Jerusalem, so they will not all be able to live inside the city walls; many will live outside the walls in the open country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC2_5" data-id="ZC2_5">Yahweh says that he himself will be like a wall of fire around the city, and he will be among the people with his glory."</span>

<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC2_8" data-id="ZC2_8">Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, honored me by telling me to go to the nations who took everything you owned, for those who harm you harm what is most precious to him! After he did that, he said this to me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC2_9" data-id="ZC2_9">"Tell them that I, Yahweh, will attack them. Their own slaves will take back their possessions from them, the people who had taken them in the first place."
