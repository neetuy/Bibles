<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_1" data-id="P14_1">Therefore, because the Messiah suffered in his body, you also be willing to suffer. Those who suffer in their bodies have stopped their sinning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_2" data-id="P14_2">As a result, during their remaining time here on earth, they do not do the things that sinful people desire to do, but instead they do the things that God wants them to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_3" data-id="P14_3">I say that to you because you have already spent too much of your time here on earth doing what the people who do not know God like to do. In the past you committed all kinds of sexually immoral acts, you got drunk and then participated in orgies and carousing, and you worshiped idols, which is disgusting to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_4" data-id="P14_4">Now your friends are surprised that you do not join with them anymore when they do these things. As a result, they say bad things about you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_5" data-id="P14_5">But one day they will have to admit to God everything they have done. He is the one who will judge them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_6" data-id="P14_6">That is the reason why the Messiah preached the good news to the dead. He did that so that, although God had judged them when they were alive, they might by the power of the Holy Spirit live forever as God lives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_7" data-id="P14_7">All things on this earth will soon come to an end. Therefore, keep thinking sensibly, and control what you think so that you can pray well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_8" data-id="P14_8">Most importantly of all, love each other sincerely, because if we love others we will not try to find out what they have done wrong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_9" data-id="P14_9">Provide food and a place to sleep for those Christian travelers who come among you, and do it without complaining.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_10" data-id="P14_10">Believers should all use the gifts that God has given them to serve others. They should manage well the various gifts that God has kindly given them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_11" data-id="P14_11">Those who speak to the assembly of believers should do that as if they were speaking the very words of God. Those who do kind deeds for others should do it with the strength that God gives them, in order that you might honor God as Jesus the Messiah enables us to do so. May we all praise God because he has all authority to rule everything forever. May it be so!</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_12" data-id="P14_12">You whom I love, do not be surprised about the painful things that you are suffering because you belong to the Messiah. Those things are testing you as people test metal by putting it into a fire. Do not think that something strange is happening to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_13" data-id="P14_13">Instead, rejoice that you are suffering the same kinds of things that the Messiah endured. Rejoice when you suffer, in order that you may also be very glad when the Messiah returns and shows everyone how glorious he is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_14" data-id="P14_14">If others insult you because you believe in the Messiah, God is pleased with you, because it shows that the Spirit of God, the Spirit who reveals how great God is, lives within you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_15" data-id="P14_15">If you suffer, do not let it be because you murdered anyone, or stole anything, or did some other kind of evil thing, or because you interfered in someone else's affairs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_16" data-id="P14_16">But if you suffer because you are a Christian, do not be ashamed about it. Instead, praise God that you are suffering because you belong to the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_17" data-id="P14_17">I say this, because it is now time for God to begin judging people, and first he will judge those who belong to him. Since he will judge us believers first, think about the terrible things that will happen to those who do not obey the good news that comes from him!</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_18" data-id="P14_18">That will be as it is written in the scriptures:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P14_18" data-id="P14_18">"Many righteous people will have to suffer many difficult trials before going to heaven.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P14_18" data-id="P14_18">So ungodly and sinful people will surely have to suffer much severe punishment from God!"</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_19" data-id="P14_19">Therefore, those who suffer because God wishes it, should trust God to keep themâ€”God is the one who created them and he is the one who always does what he promises to do. And so they should continue to do what is right.</span>
