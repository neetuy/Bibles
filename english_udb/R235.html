<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_1" data-id="R235_1">Josiah commanded that the people should celebrate the Passover Festival in Jerusalem. So they slaughtered the lambs for the Passover on the 14th day of the first month.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_2" data-id="R235_2">Josiah assigned to the priests to the tasks that they should perform at the temple, and encouraged them do their work well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_3" data-id="R235_3">The descendants of Levi were the ones who taught all the Israelite people; they had been set apart for Yahweh. Josiah said to them, "Put the sacred chest in the temple that the workers of David's son King Solomon of Israel built. But carry it on poles; do not carry it on your shoulders. And do well your work for Yahweh your God and for his Israelite people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_4" data-id="R235_4">Divide yourselves into your traditional clans, obeying the instructions that King David and his son Solomon wrote.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_5" data-id="R235_5">Then stand in the temple area, with each of you in your own Levite clan, ready to help your fellow Israelites when they bring their offerings to the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_6" data-id="R235_6">Slaughter the lambs for the Passover. Do this for your fellow Israelites. Perform the rituals to set yourselves apart for God's honor and to serve Yahweh and do his work. Prepare the sacrifices, doing what Yahweh told Moses to tell you that you should do."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_7" data-id="R235_7">Josiah provided from his own flocks and herds thirty thousand young sheep and goats for the Passover sacrifices. He also provided three thousand bulls from his own herds.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_8" data-id="R235_8">His officials also voluntarily contributed animals for the people and the priests and the other descendants of Levi. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the officials who were in charge of the temple, gave to the priests 2,600 lambs and three hundred cattle to be sacrifices for the Passover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_9" data-id="R235_9">Also, Konaniah, along with his younger brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the leaders of the descendants of Levi, provided five thousand lambs and five hundred cattle for the other descendants of Levi, to be sacrifices for the Passover.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_10" data-id="R235_10">Everything for the Passover was arranged: The priests and the other descendants of Levi stood in their places in their groups, as the king had commanded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_11" data-id="R235_11">Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs. The priests sprinkled the blood from the bowls that were handed to them, while the other descendants of Levi removed the skins from the animals.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_12" data-id="R235_12">They set aside the animals to be completely burned on the altar, in order to give them to the various family groups to offer to Yahweh, obeying the instructions that were written in the laws God gave Moses. They did the same thing with the cattle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_13" data-id="R235_13">Obeying those regulations, they roasted over the fire the lambs for the Passover. And they boiled the meat of the sacred offerings in pots and kettles and pans, and served the meat immediately to all the people who were there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_14" data-id="R235_14">After that, they prepared meat for themselves and for the priests, because the priests were busy until nighttime, sacrificing the offerings to be completely burned and burning the fat parts of the offerings. So the descendants of Levi prepared meat for themselves and for the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, the first high priest.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_15" data-id="R235_15">The musicians, who were descendants of Asaph, stood in their places, as had been commanded by King David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's prophet. The men who guarded the gates of the temple did not need to leave their places, because their fellow descendants of Levi prepared food for them to eat.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_16" data-id="R235_16">So on that day everything that needed to done for worshiping Yahweh was done. They celebrated the Passover Festival , and they presented offerings to be completely burned on the altar, which was what Josiah had commanded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_17" data-id="R235_17">The Israelites who were there celebrated the Passover on that day, and for seven days they celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_18" data-id="R235_18">The Passover Festival had not been celebrated like that in Israel since the time that the prophet Samuel lived. And none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated the Passover like Josiah did, along with the priests, the other descendants of Levi, and all the other people of Judah and Israel who were there with the people who lived in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_19" data-id="R235_19">They celebrated this Passover Festival when Josiah had been ruling for almost eighteen years.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_20" data-id="R235_20">After Josiah had done all those things to restore the worship at the temple, King Necho of Egypt went with his army to attack the city of Carchemish alongside the Euphrates River, and Josiah marched with his army to fight against them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_21" data-id="R235_21">Necho sent some messengers to Josiah, to tell him, "You are the king of Judah, and there is certainly no reason for you to fight me; we are attacking the army of Babylonia. God has told me to hurry. So stop opposing God, who is for me. If you do not stop, God will get rid of you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_22" data-id="R235_22">But Josiah would not listen to him. Instead, he disguised himself in order to be able to attack the army of Egypt without anyone recognizing him. He did not pay any attention to what God had told Necho to say. Instead, he and his army went to fight Necho's army at the plain of Megiddo.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_23" data-id="R235_23">Some archers shot King Josiah. He told his officers, "Take me away from here because I am badly wounded."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_24" data-id="R235_24">So they took him out of his chariot and put him in another chariot that he had brought with him, and they took him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs where his ancestors had been buried, and all the people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah mourned for him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_25" data-id="R235_25">The prophet Jeremiah composed a song to lament for Josiah, and all the men and women singers in Israel still mourn for Josiah by singing that song. That became a custom in Israel; the words of that song are written in a scroll of funeral songs.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">26-27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R235_26-27" data-id="R235_26-27">A record of the other things that happened while Josiah ruled, from the time he started to rule until he died, including how he faithfully was devoted to honoring God by obeying all that was written in the laws of Yahweh, is written in the book of the kings ofIsrael and Judah.</span>
