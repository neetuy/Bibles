<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_1" data-id="EC8_1">I will tell you about those who are truly wise,</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC8_1" data-id="EC8_1">with the result that they can explain why everything happens.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC8_1" data-id="EC8_1">Being wise enables people to be happy</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC8_1" data-id="EC8_1">and enables them to smile.</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_2" data-id="EC8_2">You solemnly promised God that you would obey what the king commands, so do that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_3" data-id="EC8_3">Do not do anything rashly when it concerns the king. And do not join with those who want to rebel against him, because the king will do what he wants to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_4" data-id="EC8_4">We need to obey what the king says more than we need to obey what anyone else says, for no one can say to the king, "Why are you doing that?"</span>

<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC8_5" data-id="EC8_5">he will not harm you.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC8_5" data-id="EC8_5">So be wise, and know the correct time to do things and the right way to do them.</div>

<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_6" data-id="EC8_6">Although people experience many troubles,</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC8_6" data-id="EC8_6">there is a right way to do them and a right time to do them.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_7" data-id="EC8_7">No one knows what will happen in the future,</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC8_7" data-id="EC8_7">so there is no one who can tell him what is going to happen.</div>

<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC8_8" data-id="EC8_8">and we cannot control when we will stop breathing and die.</div>

<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC8_8" data-id="EC8_8">Soldiers are not permitted to go home during a battle,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC8_8" data-id="EC8_8">and evil people will not be saved by doing what is evil.</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_9" data-id="EC8_9">I thought about all those things, and I thought about all the other things that happen on this earth. I saw that sometimes people are able to do severe harm to others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_10" data-id="EC8_10">I also saw that sometimes after evil people die, they are highly honored at their funerals by the people in the cities where they had done evil deeds. It was difficult to understand why that happens.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_11" data-id="EC8_11">If evil people are not immediately punished, it causes other people to also want to do evil things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_12" data-id="EC8_12">But even if sinful people commit a hundred crimes, and even if they live for a long time, I know that things will go better for those who honor and revere God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_13" data-id="EC8_13">I also know that things will not go well go for those who are evil, because they do not honor God. Shadows do not last a long time. Similarly, evil people will not live a long time.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_14" data-id="EC8_14">Another thing that sometimes happens on this earth is that bad things happen to righteous people, and good things happen to evil people. It is difficult to understand why that happens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_15" data-id="EC8_15">So I decided that I would recommend that people be happy while they are alive, because the best thing that people can do here on this earth is to eat and drink and be happy. Enjoying those things will help people while they do their work, all the days that God has given to them to remain alive here on the earth.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_16" data-id="EC8_16">I thought about being wise and about people who work very hard on this earth, working day and night and not taking time to sleep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_17" data-id="EC8_17">Then I thought about everything that God has done, and I realized that no one can understand everything that happens here on this earth. Truly, people are not able to fully understand everything that God does, even if they try hard to do that. Even if wise people claim that they understand it all, they cannot.</span>
