<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">1-2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_1-2" data-id="EK1_1-2">"When I, Ezekiel, was thirty years old, I was living among the Israelite people by the Kebar Canal, which was south of Babylon. The Babylonians had taken us from the land of Judah and brought us here. On the fifth day of the fourth month of that year, it was as though the sky opened and I saw visions from God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v EK1_1-2" data-id="EK1_1-2">The fifth day of the fourth month was almost five years after King Jehoiachin had been exiled."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_3" data-id="EK1_3">So God gave Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, messages in Babylonia while he was beside the Kebar Canal. Yahweh's power went to him there.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_4" data-id="EK1_4">In one of the visions, I saw a windstorm coming from the north. There was a huge cloud, and lightning was flashing within it continually, and a brilliant light surrounded the cloud. In the center of where the lightning was flashing, there was amber-colored fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_5" data-id="EK1_5">In the center of the storm I saw what resembled four living creatures. They resembled humans,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_6" data-id="EK1_6">but each of them had four faces and four wings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_7" data-id="EK1_7">Their legs were like human legs, but their feet resembled the hooves of calves that shined like polished bronze.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_8" data-id="EK1_8">On the four sides of their bodies under their wings there were hands like humans have.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_9" data-id="EK1_9">As the four creatures stood there, they formed a circle, with their wings touching each other. They did not turn when they were moving; they went straight ahead.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_10" data-id="EK1_10">Each of the creatures had four faces. In front there was a face that resembled a human face. The face on the right side resembled a lion's face. The face on the left side resembled an ox's face. The face in back resembled an eagle's face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_11" data-id="EK1_11">Two of each creature's wings were lifted up and touched the wings of the creatures that were on either side of it. The other two wings were folded against the creature's body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_12" data-id="EK1_12">The creatures went straight ahead in whatever direction the Spirit of God, who controlled them, wanted them to go, without changing directions while they were moving.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_13" data-id="EK1_13">The four creatures resembled burning coals or torches. A blazing fire moved back and forth among the creatures, and lightning flashed from among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_14" data-id="EK1_14">The creatures were moving back and forth very rapidly, so that they looked like flashes of lightning.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_15" data-id="EK1_15">While I looked at the four living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_16" data-id="EK1_16">Each of the wheels was the same, and they all shone like beryl. Each wheel seemed to have one wheel inside another wheel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_17" data-id="EK1_17">Whenever they moved, they would go straight in one of the four directions that the creatures were facing; they did not turn in another direction while they moved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_18" data-id="EK1_18">The rims of the wheels were imposing and frightening, and they were covered with eyes.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_19" data-id="EK1_19">Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels moved with them. So whenever the creatures rose up from the ground, the wheels also rose up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_20" data-id="EK1_20">Wherever the Spirit of God, who controlled the creatures, wanted them to go, they went; and the wheels went with them, because their spirit controlled the wheels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_21" data-id="EK1_21">Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels moved. Whenever the creatures stood still, the wheels stopped. Whenever the creatures rose up from the ground, the wheels rose up with them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_22" data-id="EK1_22">Above the heads of the creatures there was something that resembled a dome. It glistened as ice shines, and it was awesome.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_23" data-id="EK1_23">Under the dome, the creatures stretched out their wings. Each one had two wings that touched the wings of the creatures on either side, and two wings that covered his own body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_24" data-id="EK1_24">Whenever the creatures moved, their wings made a sound that resembled the crashing of waves in the sea. It also sounded like the voice of Almighty God, and like the noise of a huge army marching. Whenever the creatures stood still on the ground, they lowered their wings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_25" data-id="EK1_25">While they stood on the ground with their wings lowered, there was a voice from the dome that was over their heads.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_26" data-id="EK1_26">Above the dome was something that resembled a huge throne that was made of a huge sapphire. Sitting on the throne was someone who resembled a human.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_27" data-id="EK1_27">I saw that above his waist he resembled metal that was glowing as though it had a very hot fire inside it. And I saw that below his waist there was a very brilliant light that surrounded him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_28" data-id="EK1_28">It shone like a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v EK1_28" data-id="EK1_28">That was the brilliant light that represented the presence of Yahweh. When I saw it, I threw myself flat onto the ground, and I heard him speak!</span>
