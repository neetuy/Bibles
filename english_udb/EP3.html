<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_1" data-id="EP3_1">Because God has done all this for you non-Jews, the Messiah Jesus has put me, Paul, in prison for your sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_2" data-id="EP3_2">I assume that you know that God has honored me by giving me a certain task to do for your sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_3" data-id="EP3_3">He gave me this task because of the secret truth about which I wrote to you briefly;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_4" data-id="EP3_4">when you read what I have already written briefly about that, you will be able to understand that I clearly understand the truth about the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_5" data-id="EP3_5">Formerly, God did not fully reveal the good news that was to come to anyone. It was something that no one understood, but now his Spirit has revealed the good news to his apostles and prophets whom the Spirit called to serve God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_6" data-id="EP3_6">This hidden truth is that the non-Jews now share together with Jews the spiritual riches of God, and belong to the same group of God's people, and will share all the things God has promised them because they are joined to the Messiah Jesusâ€”this is the good news.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_7" data-id="EP3_7">I am now God's servant to spread the good news, a work I did not deserve to do, but which God gave me working in me with his power.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_8" data-id="EP3_8">Although I am the least worthy of all God's people, God has enabled me by his kindness and mercy to proclaim to non-Jews the good news about what the Messiah has done for us, which is so much that no one can learn all about it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_9" data-id="EP3_9">My mission is to explain to everyone what God's plan is, something that God has kept hidden from long ago, from the time when he created everything.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_10" data-id="EP3_10">What God has wisely planned, he has even shown to powerful angels in heaven through his people who trust in the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_11" data-id="EP3_11">That is what God had always planned for eternity, and it is what he accomplished through the work of the Messiah Jesus our Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_12" data-id="EP3_12">So now when we pray, we can come to God confidently and without being afraid, because we trust in Jesus, who has fulfilled God's plan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_13" data-id="EP3_13">So I ask that you do not be discouraged because of my suffering many things for you here in prison, which actually end up honoring you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_14" data-id="EP3_14">Because God has done all this for you, I kneel and pray to God our Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_15" data-id="EP3_15">He is the one who gives every family in heaven and on the earth their name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_16" data-id="EP3_16">I pray because of his great power that God will give you power and will strengthen you by his Spirit who lives in your spirits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_17" data-id="EP3_17">I pray that the Messiah may live in your hearts because you trust in him, and that you will be like a firmly rooted tree and a building founded upon stone,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_18" data-id="EP3_18">so that you may be fully able to understand, along with the all those set apart for God, how wide and long and high and deep is the love of the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_19" data-id="EP3_19">For this love is so great that we cannot understand it, but because of this love, I pray that God may fill you all with himself.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_20" data-id="EP3_20">God is able to do much greater things than we usually ask him to do, or even that we might think that he can do, because of his power that is working within us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_21" data-id="EP3_21">May all believers assembled to worship God, and the Messiah Jesus himself, honor God more than they honor anything else. May all believers from all generations of history praise him forever and ever! So let it be done.</span>
