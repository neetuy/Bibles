<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_1" data-id="JR39_1">After King Zedekiah had been ruling Judah for almost nine years, King Nebuchadnezzar came in the tenth month of the year with his army, and they surrounded Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_2" data-id="JR39_2">One and a half years later, after Zedekiah had been ruling for almost eleven years, in the eleventh year and fourth month, soldiers from Babylonia broke through the city wall. Then they rushed in and captured the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_3" data-id="JR39_3">Then all the officers of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate to decide what they would do to the city. They included Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar Nebo, Sarsekim who was one of the chief administrative officers, Nergal-Sharezer, the king's advisor, and many other officials.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_4" data-id="JR39_4">When King Zedekiah and all his soldiers realized that the army of Babylonia had broken into the city, they fled. They waited until it was dark. Then they went out of the city through the king's garden, through the gate that was between the two walls. Then they started running toward the plain along the Jordan.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_5" data-id="JR39_5">But the soldiers from Babylonia pursued the king, and they caught him on the plains near Jericho. They took him to the king of Babylon, who was at Riblah in the Hamath. There Nebuchadnezzar told his soldiers what they should do to punish Zedekiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_6" data-id="JR39_6">They forced Zedekiah to watch while they killed his sons and all the officials from Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_7" data-id="JR39_7">Then they gouged out Zedekiah's eyes. They fastened him with bronze chains and took him to Babylon.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_8" data-id="JR39_8">Meanwhile, the Babylonian army burned the palace and all the other buildings in Jerusalem. And they tore down the city walls.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_9" data-id="JR39_9">Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the king's bodyguards, forced to go to Babylon most of the other people who remained in the city and the Jews who had joined the soldiers of Babylonia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_10" data-id="JR39_10">But he allowed some of the very poor people to remain in Judah, and he gave them vineyards and fields to take care of.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_11" data-id="JR39_11">King Nebuchadnezzar had previously told the captain of the guard, Nebuzaradan to find Jeremiah. He said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_12" data-id="JR39_12">"Make sure that no one harms him. Take care of him, and do for him whatever he requests you to do."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_13" data-id="JR39_13">So he and Nebushazban, who was one of their chief officers, and Nergal-Sharezer the king's advisor, and other officers of the king of Babylon</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_14" data-id="JR39_14">sent some men to bring Jeremiah out of the courtyard outside of the palace. They took him to Gedaliah who was the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. Then Gedaliah took Jeremiah to his home, and he stayed in Judah among his own people who had been allowed to remain there.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_15" data-id="JR39_15">But while Jeremiah was still being guarded in the palace courtyard, Yahweh gave him this message:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_16" data-id="JR39_16">"Say this to Ebed-Melek, the official from Ethiopia: 'This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, the God whom Israel worships, says: I will do to this city everything that I said that I would do. Everthing I told you would be done, and you will see it with your own eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_17" data-id="JR39_17">But I promise to rescue you from the people you are afraid of. This is what I, Yahweh, have promised to you!</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR39_18" data-id="JR39_18">You trusted me, so I will save you. You will not be killed by our enemies' swords. You will live. That will surely happen, because I, Yahweh, have said it.'"</span>
