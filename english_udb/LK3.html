No one warned you that one day God will punish everyone who sins, did they? Do not think that you can escape from him!</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_8" data-id="LK3_8">Do the things that show that you have truly turned away from your sinful behavior! And do not start saying to yourself, 'We are descendants of Abraham!' Because I tell you that God could make even these stones become descendants of Abraham!</span>

<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_10" data-id="LK3_10">Then some of the people in the crowd asked him, "What, then, should we do?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_11" data-id="LK3_11">He answered them, "If any of you has two shirts, you should give one of them to someone who does not have a shirt.

<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_12" data-id="LK3_12">Some tax collectors also came to John to be baptized. They asked him, "Teacher, what should we do?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_13" data-id="LK3_13">He said to them, "Do not collect from the people more money than the Roman government tells you to collect!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_14" data-id="LK3_14">Some soldiers asked him, "And us? What should we do?"

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_15" data-id="LK3_15">People were getting very hopeful that the Messiah might be coming soon, and many of them were wondering if John might be the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_16" data-id="LK3_16">But John replied to them all, "No, I am not. The Messiah is far greater than I am. He is so great that I am not worthy even to untie the straps of his sandals! When I baptized you, I used only water. But when the Messiah comes, he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_20" data-id="LK3_20">Then Herod had his soldiers put John in prison, which was another very evil thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_21" data-id="LK3_21">But before John was put in prison, when many people were being baptized, Jesus also was baptized. Afterwards, while he was praying, the sky opened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_22" data-id="LK3_22">Then the Holy Spirit, resembling a dove, came down and landed on Jesus. And God spoke to Jesus from heaven, saying, "You are my Son, the one whom I love dearly. I am very pleased with you!"</span>
