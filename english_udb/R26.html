<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_1" data-id="R26_1">Then Solomon prayed, "Yahweh, you said that you would live in a dark cloud.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_3" data-id="R26_3">Then while all the people stood there, Solomon turned toward the people and asked God to bless them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_4" data-id="R26_4">He said to them,</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v R26_4" data-id="R26_4">"Let us praise Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong, who has caused to happen what he promised to my father David. What he said to David was this:</span>

<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_5" data-id="R26_5">'From the time that I brought my people out of Egypt, I have never chosen a city in Israel in which a temple should be built for people to worship me there. Nor did I choose anyone to be the leader of my Israelite people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_6" data-id="R26_6">But now I have chosen Jerusalem to be the place for people to worship me, and I have chosen you, David, to rule my Israelite people.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_7" data-id="R26_7">Then Solomon said further, "My father David wanted to build a temple for Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_8" data-id="R26_8">But Yahweh said to him, 'It is good that you wanted to build a house for me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_9" data-id="R26_9">However, you are not the one who I want to build the temple, It is one of your own sons who will build it.'</span>

<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_10" data-id="R26_10">And Yahweh has done what he promised to do. I have become the king of Israel to rule after my father, and I am ruling the people, as Yahweh promised, and I have arranged for this temple to be built for us to worship Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_11" data-id="R26_11">I have put the sacred chest in the temple, in which are the stone tablets showing the covenant that Yahweh made with us Israelite people."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_12" data-id="R26_12">Then Solomon stood in front of the altar that was in front of the people of Israel who had gathered there. He spread out his hands as he began to pray.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_13" data-id="R26_13">Now His workers had built a bronze platform there for him to stand on, which was two and one-third meters square and one and one-half meters high. They had put it in the outer courtyard. Solomon mounted that platform and then knelt down in front of all the people of Israel who had gathered there, and he spread out his arms toward heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_14" data-id="R26_14">Then he prayed,</span>

<span class="v R26_14" data-id="R26_14">"Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelite people belong, there is no God like you in heaven or on the earth. You solemnly promised in your covenant that you would faithfully love us, and that is what you have done for us who earnestly do what you want us to do.</span>

<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_15" data-id="R26_15">You have done the things that you promised my father David, who served you very well, that you would do. Truly, you promised to do those things for him, and today we see that by your power you have caused it all to happen.</span>
</div>
<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_16" data-id="R26_16">So now, Yahweh, the God we Israelites worship Israel, as you promised your servant David, my father, please make sure that he will always have a descendant who will be king of Israel. For you promise you would do this if his descendants were faithful to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_17" data-id="R26_17">So now, God of us Israelite people, cause what you promised David, who served you well, to become true.</span>

<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_18" data-id="R26_18">But, my God, will you really live on earth among us? This temple I have built cannot contain you; not even the universe and heaven itself can contain you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_19" data-id="R26_19">But Yahweh, my God, please listen to my prayer, while I am pleading with this day and do what I am requesting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_20" data-id="R26_20">Always protect this temple, this place where you said you would be present, in order that you might always hear me when I pray, for I am your servant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_21" data-id="R26_21">Listen to me when I pray, and listen to your Israelite people when they pray, whether we are here, or even if we just face in this direction.

<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_22" data-id="R26_22">If people accuse someone of doing something wrong to another person, and if they bring him in front of your altar outside this holy temple, and if he says, 'I did not do that; may God punish me if I am not telling the truth,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_23" data-id="R26_23">then please listen from heaven and decide who is telling the truth. Then punish the person who is guilty as he deserves to be punished, and do good to the other person as a reward for his innocence.</span>
</div>
<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_24" data-id="R26_24">And suppose that your Israelite people are defeated by their enemies because they sinned against you, and forced to go to some distant country. Suppose further that they turn away from their sinful behavior and face in the direction of this temple and acknowledge that you have justly punished them; and suppose that they beg you to forgive them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_25" data-id="R26_25">Then please listen to them from heaven and forgive your them for the sins that they have committed, and bring them back to this land that you gave to our ancestors.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_27" data-id="R26_27">then listen from heaven and forgive the sins of your people. Teach them the right way to conduct their lives. Then send rain on the land that you gave to your people forever.</span>

<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_28" data-id="R26_28">And when the people of this land experience famines, or if there is a plague or mildew or locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemies surround any of their cities in order to attack them—if any of these disaster happens to them—</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_29" data-id="R26_29">and then if your Israelite people earnestly plead, or if even just one person does so—if they stretch out their hands toward this temple and pray to you because they know the weakness and sorrow in their own hearts—</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_30" data-id="R26_30">then listen from your home in heaven and forgive them. You alone know what each person is thinking, so reward each person according to everything that he does.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_31" data-id="R26_31">Do this in order that they might honor you and conduct their lives as you want them to, all the time that they live in this land that you gave to our ancestors.</span>

If they turn toward this temple and pray,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_33" data-id="R26_33">then from your home in heaven please listen to their prayer and do for them what they request you to do. Do that in order that all the people groups in the world will honor and obey you, as your people of Israel do. And do this so that they will know that you are present in this temple that I have built.</span>
</div>
<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_34" data-id="R26_34">When you send your people to go and attack their enemies, if they pray to you, no matter where they are, and if they turn toward this city that you have chosen and toward this temple that I have caused to be built to honor you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_35" data-id="R26_35">then will you please listen from heaven to their prayers. Listen to what they plead for you to do, and give them help.</span>

<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_36" data-id="R26_36">It is true that everyone sins.

<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_38" data-id="R26_38">suppose that they repent very sincerely and pray facing this land that you gave their ancestors, and facing this city that you chose, and facing this temple that I have built for you to be present in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_39" data-id="R26_39">Then from your home in heaven listen to their prayer, and listen to them while they plead for your help, and do what they ask you to do, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.</span>
