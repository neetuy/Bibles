<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV7_28" data-id="LV7_28">Yahweh also said to Moses,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV7_29" data-id="LV7_29">"Tell the Israelite people this: 'Anyone who brings an offering to promise friendship with Yahweh must bring part of it to be a sacrifice to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV7_30" data-id="LV7_30">He himself must bring the offering that will be burned in the fire. He must bring the fat along with the breast of the animal and lift it high in front of Yahweh to present it as an offering to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV7_31" data-id="LV7_31">The priest must burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and all his descendants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV7_32" data-id="LV7_32">You must give to the priest the right thigh of the animal that you presented to promise friendship with Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV7_33" data-id="LV7_33">The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of that sacrifice will receive the right thigh of the animal as his share.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV7_34" data-id="LV7_34">From the offerings that the Israelite people give to promise friendship with Yahweh, he has declared that he has given to Aaron and his descendants the breast that is lifted high and the right thigh that is offered. Those portions will always be their regular share from the Israelite people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV7_35" data-id="LV7_35">Those are the portions of the offerings brought to Yahweh and burned in fire that are allotted to Aaron and his descendants on the day that you, Moses, will set apart to serve Yahweh as priests.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV7_36" data-id="LV7_36">Yahweh commands that on the day that the priests are appointed, that the Israelite people must always give those portions to the priests.'"</span>
