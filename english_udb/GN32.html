<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_1" data-id="GN32_1">As Jacob and his family continued traveling, some angels came from God and met him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_2" data-id="GN32_2">When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is God's army camp!" So he named that place Mahanaim.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_3" data-id="GN32_3">Jacob told some men to go ahead of him to his older brother Esau, who was living in Seir, that is, the land of Edom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_4" data-id="GN32_4">He told them, "This is what I want you to say to Esau: 'I, Jacob, am your servant and you are my master. I have been living with our uncle Laban, and I have stayed there until now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_5" data-id="GN32_5">I now own many cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and male and female slaves. Now I am sending this message to you, sir, hoping that you will be friendly toward me when I arrive.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_6" data-id="GN32_6">The messengers went and gave that message to Esau. When they returned to Jacob, they said, "We went to your older brother Esau. He is coming to you, and four hundred men are coming with him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_7" data-id="GN32_7">Jacob was very afraid and worried. So he divided the people who were with him into two groups. He also divided the sheep and goats, the cattle, and the camels, into two groups.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_8" data-id="GN32_8">He was thinking, "If Esau and his men come and attack us, perhaps one of the groups will be left and will be able to escape."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_9" data-id="GN32_9">Then Jacob prayed, "O Yahweh God, whom my grandfather Abraham worshiped and my father Isaac worships, you said to me, 'Go back to your own land and to your relatives, and I will cause good things to happen to you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_10" data-id="GN32_10">I am not worthy for you to have kept your covenant in so many faithful and trustworthy ways with me, your servant. I had only this walking stick with me when I crossed the Jordan River on my way to Haran, but now I am so wealthy that there are two large groups of my family and possessions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_11" data-id="GN32_11">So now I pray that you will rescue me from the power of my brother Esau, because I am afraid that he and his men will come and attack and kill me and the children and their mothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_12" data-id="GN32_12">But do not forget that you have said, 'I will certainly enable you to prosper, and I will cause your descendants to be as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore, which are so many that no one can count them.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_13" data-id="GN32_13">Jacob slept in that place that night. The next morning he selected some animals to give to his brother Esau.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_14" data-id="GN32_14">He selected two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred female sheep and twenty male sheep,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_15" data-id="GN32_15">thirty female camels and their offspring, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_16" data-id="GN32_16">He divided them into small herds, and put each herd into the care of one of his servants. He said to his servants, "Go ahead of me, one group at a time, and keep some space between each herd."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_17" data-id="GN32_17">He said to the servant who was going with the first group, "When my brother Esau meets you, he will ask you, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these animals in front of you belong?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_18" data-id="GN32_18">Tell him, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. He has sent them to you as a gift, sir. And he is coming behind us.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_19" data-id="GN32_19">He also said the same thing to the servants who were taking care of the second and third groups, and to the other herdsmen. He said to them, "When you meet Esau, I want you to say to him the same thing that I told the first servant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_20" data-id="GN32_20">Also be sure to say 'Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'" Jacob told them to say that because he was thinking, "Perhaps these gifts that I am sending ahead of me will cause him to act peacefully toward me. Later, when I see him, perhaps he will act kindly toward me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_21" data-id="GN32_21">So the men taking the gifts went ahead, but Jacob himself stayed in the camp that night.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_22" data-id="GN32_22">Some time during that night, Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female slaves, and his eleven sons, and he sent them across the ford at the Jabbok River.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_23" data-id="GN32_23">After he sent all his people across the Jabbok River, then he also sent over everything he owned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_24" data-id="GN32_24">So Jacob was left there alone. But a man came and wrestled with him until dawn.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_25" data-id="GN32_25">When the man realized that he was not winning against Jacob, he struck Jacob's hip and caused the thigh bone to pull away from the hip socket.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_26" data-id="GN32_26">Then the man said, "Let me go, because it will soon be daylight." Jacob replied, "No, if you will not bless me, I will not let you go!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_27" data-id="GN32_27">The man said to him, "What is your name?" He replied, "Jacob."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_28" data-id="GN32_28">The man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob. Your name will be Israel, which means 'he struggles with God,' because you have struggled with God and with people, and you have won."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_29" data-id="GN32_29">Jacob said, "Now, please tell me your name!" The man replied, "Why do you ask me what my name is?" But he blessed Jacob there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_30" data-id="GN32_30">So Jacob named the place Peniel, which means "God's face," saying "I looked directly at God, but I did not die because of doing that."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_31" data-id="GN32_31">The sun was rising as Jacob left Peniel, and he was limping because of what had happened to his hip.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_32" data-id="GN32_32">The muscle on his hip joint had been injured. So to this present time, because of what happened to Jacob, the Israelite people do not eat the muscle that is attached to the socket of the hips of animals.</span>
