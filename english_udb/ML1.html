<div class="pi">
<span class="v ML1_2-3" data-id="ML1_2-3">"Is it not true that Esau and Jacob were brothers? Yet I have a covenant with Jacob and his descendants, but I have no covenant with Esau and his descendants. I caused Esau's region to be abandoned, a place where wild dogs live."</span>

<div class="pi">
<span class="v ML1_4" data-id="ML1_4">"They may build houses again, but I will demolish them again. Their country will be called 'The land where wicked people live,' and their people will be called 'The people with whom Yahweh is angry forever.'"</span>
