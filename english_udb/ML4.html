When that happens, it will be like a day that they burn the useless remains of crops in the fields. Those people will burn up completelyâ€”as roots and branches and everything else on a tree burns completely in a very hot fire.</span>

You will be as happy as young calves when they leave their stalls to play in the fields.</span>
