<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_3" data-id="EX34_3">Do not allow anyone to come up with you. I do not want anyone else to be anywhere on the mountain. Do not even allow any sheep or cattle to graze at the base of the mountain."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_4" data-id="EX34_4">So Moses cut two slabs of stone that were like the first ones.

<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_5" data-id="EX34_5">Then Yahweh came down in the tall cloud and stood with Moses there. Then he pronounced his own name, Yahweh, in front of Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_6" data-id="EX34_6">Yahweh passed in front of him and said, "I am Yahweh God.

<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_15" data-id="EX34_15">Do not make a covenant to live peacefully with any group that lives in that land. When they worship their gods and offer sacrifices to them and invite you to join them, do not join them. If you join them, you will eat the food that they sacrifice to their gods, and you will not be faithful to me. You will be like women who commit adultery, who are not faithful to their husbands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_16" data-id="EX34_16">If you take some of their women to be wives for your sons, these women will worship their own gods, and they will also make your sons worship their gods.</span>
