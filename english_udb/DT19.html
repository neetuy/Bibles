<div class="c">19</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_1" data-id="DT19_1">After Yahweh our God has destroyed the people groups from the land that he is giving to you, and after you have driven them out from their cities and you start to live in their houses,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">2-3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_2-3" data-id="DT19_2-3">you must divide into three parts the land that he is giving to you. Then select a city in each part. You must make good roads in order that people can get to those cities easily. Someone who kills another person can escape to one of those cities to be safe.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_4" data-id="DT19_4">This is the rule about someone who has killed another person. If someone accidentally kills another person who was not his enemy, he may escape to one of those cities and be safe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_5" data-id="DT19_5">For example, if two men go into the forest to cut some wood, if the axe head comes off the handle while one of them is chopping down a tree and the ax head strikes and kills the other man, the man who was using the ax will be allowed to run to one of those cities and be safe there, because the people of that city will protect him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_6" data-id="DT19_6">Because he accidentally killed someone, and because the man was not his enemy, he can try to run to one of those cities. If there were only one city, it may be a long distance to that city. Then if the relative of the man who was killed to get revenge, is very angry, he may be able to catch the other person before he arrives at that city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_7" data-id="DT19_7">Therefore, I give you this command, that you select three cities for this purpose.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">8-9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_8-9" data-id="DT19_8-9">If you do everything that I am today commanding you to do, and if you love Yahweh our God, and if you conduct your lives as he wants you to do, Yahweh our God will give you much more land than you will have when you first occupy it, which is what he promised to do. He will give you all the land which he promised your ancestors that he would give to you. When he gives you that land, you must select three more cities to which people may escape.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_10" data-id="DT19_10">Do this in order that people who are innocent will not die, and you will not be guilty for allowing them to be executed, in the land that Yahweh is giving to you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_11" data-id="DT19_11">But suppose someone hates his enemy and hides and waits for that person to come along the road. Then when he passes by, suddenly he attacks him and murders him. If the attacker flees to one of those cities to be protected there,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_12" data-id="DT19_12">the elders of the city where the murdered man lived must not protect the attacker. They must send someone to the city to which the other man escaped, and bring him to to get revenge, so that he may execute that man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_13" data-id="DT19_13">You must not pity those who murder other people! Instead, you must execute them, in order that the people in the land of Israel will not be punished for murdering innocent people, and in order that things will go well for you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_14" data-id="DT19_14">When you are living in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, do not move the markers of your neighbors' property boundaries that were placed there long ago.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_15" data-id="DT19_15">If someone is accused of committing a crime, one person who says, 'I saw him do it' is not enough to find him guilty. There must be at least two people who say, 'We saw him do it.' If there is only one witness, the judge must not believe that what he says is true.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_16" data-id="DT19_16">Or suppose that someone tries to do wrong to another person by falsely accusing him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_17" data-id="DT19_17">Then both of them must go to the place where the people worship, to talk to the priests and judges who are serving at that time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_18" data-id="DT19_18">The judges must investigate the case carefully. If the judges determine that one of them has accused the other falsely,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_19" data-id="DT19_19">that person must be punished in the same way that the other one would have been punished if the judges had decided that he was guilty. By punishing such people, you will get rid of this evil practice from among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_20" data-id="DT19_20">And when that person is punished, everyone will hear what has happened, and they will be afraid, and no one will dare to act that way anymore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_21" data-id="DT19_21">You must not pity people who are punished like that. The rule should be that a person who has murdered someone else must be executed; one of a person's eyes must be gouged out if he has gouged out someone else's eye, one tooth of a person who has knocked out the tooth of another person must be knocked out; one hand of a person who has cut off the hand of another person must likewise be cut off; one foot of a person who has cut off the foot of another person must also be cut off.</span>
