<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_7" data-id="C116_7">I do not want to see you for only a short time. I hope that the Lord will allow me to spend enough time together that we can help each other.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_13" data-id="C116_13">Be on guard, do not wander from your faith. Work for the Lord like grown men, and be strong.</span>
