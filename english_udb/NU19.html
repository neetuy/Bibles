<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU19_2" data-id="NU19_2">"I am now giving to you another regulation. Tell the Israelite people to bring to you one reddish brown cow that has no defects. It must be an animal that has never been used for plowing ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU19_3" data-id="NU19_3">Give it to Eleazar the priest. He must take it outside the camp and someone will slaughter it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU19_13" data-id="NU19_13">All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual to become acceptable to me again, defile Yahweh's sacred tent. They will no longer be permitted to live among the Israelite people. The water to remove the guilt of sin was not sprinkled on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU19_14" data-id="NU19_14">There is another practice that must be performed when someone dies inside a tent.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU19_17" data-id="NU19_17">For someone like that to become acceptable to me again, some of the ashes from the cow that was burned must be taken and put in a jar. Then some fresh water must be poured over the ashes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU19_18" data-id="NU19_18">Then someone who has not become unacceptable to me must take a stalk of a plant named hyssop and dip it into the water. Then that person must sprinkle some of the water on the tent where that person died, on the things that are in the tent, and on the people who were in the tent. He must also sprinkle some of that water on any person who touched a human bone or who touched a person who had been killed, or who touched a person who died of natural causes, or who touched a grave.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU19_21" data-id="NU19_21">That is a law for the Israelite people that will never be changed.
