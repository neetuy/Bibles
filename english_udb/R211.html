<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R211_15" data-id="R211_15">Instead, Jeroboam appointed the priests that he wanted to work at the altars he commanded to be built on the hills all around the cities, to offer sacrifices to the idols that he commanded to be made that resembled goats and calves.</span>
