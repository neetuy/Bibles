<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_1" data-id="LK1_1">Dear Theophilus,</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v LK1_1" data-id="LK1_1">Many people have written reports about the amazing events that have happened among us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_2" data-id="LK1_2">We heard about these things from people who saw them happen, from the time everything first started happening. These people taught others about God's message.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_3" data-id="LK1_3">I myself have carefully studied everything that these people wrote and taught. So I decided that it would also be good for me to write for you, noble Theophilus, an accurate account of these matters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_4" data-id="LK1_4">I am doing this so that you may know that what you have been taught about these things is true.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_5" data-id="LK1_5">When King Herod ruled the province of Judea, there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah. He belonged to the group of priests called the Abijah group. He and his wife Elizabeth were both descended from Aaron.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_6" data-id="LK1_6">God considered that both of them were righteous, because they always obeyed without fault everything that God had commanded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_7" data-id="LK1_7">But they had no children, because Elizabeth was unable to bear children. Furthermore, she and her husband were very old.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_8" data-id="LK1_8">One day Zechariah was serving as a priest in the temple in Jerusalem during his group's regular time of service there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_9" data-id="LK1_9">Following their custom, the priests chose him by lot to go into the Lord's temple and burn incense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_10" data-id="LK1_10">When the time came for him to burn the incense, many people were praying in the courtyard outside the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_11" data-id="LK1_11">Then an angel whom the Lord had sent appeared to him. The angel was standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_12" data-id="LK1_12">When Zechariah saw the angel, he was startled and became very afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_13" data-id="LK1_13">But the angel said to him, "Zechariah, do not be afraid! When you prayed, the Lord heard your request. So your wife Elizabeth will bear a son for you. You must name him John.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_14" data-id="LK1_14">You will be very happy, and many other people will also be happy because he is born.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_15" data-id="LK1_15">God will consider him to be very important. He must never drink wine or any other alcoholic drink. He will be empowered by the Holy Spirit even before he is born.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_16" data-id="LK1_16">He will persuade many descendants of Israel to stop sinning and start obeying the Lord their God again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_17" data-id="LK1_17">Your son will go in advance of the Lord as his forerunner and will be powerful in his spirit like the prophet Elijah was. He will cause parents to love their children again. He will cause many people who do not obey God to live wisely and to obey him as righteous people do. He will do this in order to cause many people to be ready when the Lord comes."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_18" data-id="LK1_18">Then Zechariah said to the angel, "I am very old, and my wife is also very old. So how can I believe that the things you said will really happen?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_19" data-id="LK1_19">Then the angel said to him, "I am Gabriel! I stand in God's presence! I was sent to tell you this good news about what will happen to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_20" data-id="LK1_20">What I have told you will certainly happen at the time God has decided, but you did not believe my words. So now God will cause you to be unable to talk until the day your son is born!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_21" data-id="LK1_21">While Zechariah and the angel were talking in the temple, the people in the courtyard were waiting for Zechariah to come out. They wondered why he was staying in the temple for such a long time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_22" data-id="LK1_22">When he came out, he was not able to speak to them. Because he could not talk, he made motions with his hands to try to explain what had happened. Then they realized that he had seen a vision from God while he was in the temple.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_23" data-id="LK1_23">When Zechariah's time to work as a priest in the temple was finished, he left Jerusalem and went to his home.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_24" data-id="LK1_24">Some time after this, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant, but she did not go out in public for five months.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_25" data-id="LK1_25">She said to herself, "The Lord has enabled me to become pregnant. In this way, he had compassion on me and has taken away the reason that people looked down on me!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_26" data-id="LK1_26">When Elizabeth had been pregnant for almost six months, God sent the angel Gabriel to the town of Nazareth in the district of Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_27" data-id="LK1_27">He went there to speak to a virgin who was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, who was a descendant of King David. The virgin's name was Mary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_28" data-id="LK1_28">The angel said to her, "Greetings! The Lord is with you and has shown great kindness to you!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_29" data-id="LK1_29">But Mary felt very troubled when she heard his greeting. She wondered what the angel meant by these words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_30" data-id="LK1_30">Then the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have received favor from God!</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_31" data-id="LK1_31">You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you must name him Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_32" data-id="LK1_32">He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High God. The Lord God will make him a king over his people as his ancestor David was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_33" data-id="LK1_33">He will rule forever over the descendants of Jacob. He will rule forever!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_34" data-id="LK1_34">Then Mary said to the angel, "How can this happen, since I am a virgin?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_35" data-id="LK1_35">The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit will come to you and the power of God will cover you. So the baby you will bear will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_36" data-id="LK1_36">And listen to this. Your relative Elizabeth is pregnant with a son, even though she is very old. And though people thought that she could not bear children, she has now been pregnant for almost six months.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_37" data-id="LK1_37">For God can do anything!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_38" data-id="LK1_38">Then Mary said, "All right, I am the Lord's servant, so let what you have said about me happen!" Then the angel left her.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_39" data-id="LK1_39">Very soon after that, Mary got ready and went quickly to the highlands of Judea, to the city where Zechariah lived.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_40" data-id="LK1_40">She entered his house and greeted his wife Elizabeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_41" data-id="LK1_41">As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary greet her, the baby leaped inside Elizabeth's womb. Immediately the Holy Spirit guided Elizabeth to start praising God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_42" data-id="LK1_42">She exclaimed loudly to Mary, "God has blessed you more than he has blessed other women, and he has blessed the baby you will bear!</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_43" data-id="LK1_43">How wonderful it is that you, the mother of my Lord, have come to me!</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_44" data-id="LK1_44">As soon as I heard you greet me, the baby in my womb leaped because he was so happy that you had come!</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_45" data-id="LK1_45">You are blessed because you believed that what the Lord told you would come true."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">Then Mary praised God by saying:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">"Oh, how I praise the Lord!</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">\v 47 I feel very joyful about God,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">who is the one who saves me.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">\v 48 I was only his lowly servant girl, but he did not forget me.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">So from now on, people living in all time periods will say that God has blessed me.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">\v 49 They will say this because of the great things that God, the Powerful One, has done for me.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">His name is holy!</div>
</span>

</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">\v 52 He has stopped kings from ruling,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">and he has honored people who are oppressed.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">\v 53 He has given good things to eat to those who are hungry,</div>

</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">\v 54-55 He has helped Israel, the people who serve him.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">Long ago he promised our ancestors that he would be merciful to them.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">He has kept that promise and has always acted mercifully toward Abraham and all who descended from him."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-56 " data-id="bibleJsn">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_56" data-id="LK1_56">Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months. Then she returned to her home.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-57 " data-id="bibleJsn">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_57" data-id="LK1_57">When it was time for Elizabeth to bear her child, she bore a son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-58 " data-id="bibleJsn">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_58" data-id="LK1_58">Her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had been so kind to her, and they were happy along with Elizabeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59 " data-id="bibleJsn">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_59" data-id="LK1_59">On the eighth day after this, people gathered together for the ceremony to circumcise the baby. Since his father's name was Zechariah, they wanted to give the baby the same name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-60 " data-id="bibleJsn">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_60" data-id="LK1_60">But his mother said, "No, his name must be John!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-61 " data-id="bibleJsn">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_61" data-id="LK1_61">So they said to her, "But John is not the name of any of your relatives!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-62 " data-id="bibleJsn">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_62" data-id="LK1_62">Then they made motions with their hands to his father, for him to indicate what name he wanted to be given to his son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-63 " data-id="bibleJsn">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_63" data-id="LK1_63">So he signaled that they should give him a tablet to write on. When they gave him one, he wrote on it, "His name is John." All those who were there were surprised!</span>
<span class="v-num v-64 " data-id="bibleJsn">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_64" data-id="LK1_64">Immediately Zechariah was able to speak again, and he began praising God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-65 " data-id="bibleJsn">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_65" data-id="LK1_65">Everyone who lived nearby was completely awed by what God had done. They told many other people about what had happened and the news spread all over the highlands of Judea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-66 " data-id="bibleJsn">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_66" data-id="LK1_66">Everyone who heard it kept thinking about it. They were saying, "We wonder what work this child will do when he grows up!" Because of everything that had happened, they were sure that God would be helping him in a powerful way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-67 " data-id="bibleJsn">67&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_67" data-id="LK1_67">After Zechariah's son was born, Zechariah was controlled by the Holy Spirit and he spoke these words from God:</span>
