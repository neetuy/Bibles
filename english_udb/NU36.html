<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU36_2" data-id="NU36_2">They said to Moses, "Yahweh commanded you, our leader, to apportion the land to the Israelite tribes by casting lots to decide which group would get which area. Yahweh also commanded you to give the land that belonged to our fellow Israelite Zelophehad to his daughters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU36_3" data-id="NU36_3">But if his daughters marry men from the other Israelite tribes, that land will no longer belong to our tribe. People of other tribes will get it. So some of our land will no longer belong to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU36_4" data-id="NU36_4">When the year of the celebration of Jubilee comes, when all the land that has been bought by someone is returned to its original owners, the land that belonged to Zelophehad will belong to the tribes of the men that his daughters marry. So some of our land, the land that we received from our fathers, will be taken from us, and we will never own it again."</span>

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU36_7" data-id="NU36_7">In that way, the land that belongs to Israelites will not be passed from one tribe to another tribe. Each Israelite will keep the land in the tribe that belonged to his ancestors.</span>
