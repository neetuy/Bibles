<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_1" data-id="JR18_1">Yahweh gave another message to me. He said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_2" data-id="JR18_2">"Go to the shop of the man who makes clay pots. I will give you a message there."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_3" data-id="JR18_3">So I went to that shop, and I saw the man who makes pots. He was working at the wheel that he uses to form pots.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_4" data-id="JR18_4">But when he finished making one jar, it was not as good as he hoped it to be. So, he took the clay and formed it into another jar, shaping it as he desired to.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_5" data-id="JR18_5">Then Yahweh gave me this message:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_6" data-id="JR18_6">"Perhaps the people of Israel think that I cannot do to them like this man who makes pots has done. But what they think is wrong. I can control what happens to them like this man controls what he does with the clay in his hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_7" data-id="JR18_7">There may be a time when I proclaim that I will get rid of a nation or kingdom, like someone pulls up a plant with its roots, and smash it, and destroy it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_8" data-id="JR18_8">But if the people of that nation repent of doing evil things, I will not send to them the disasters that I planned to send.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_9" data-id="JR18_9">And there may be a time when I proclaim that I will establish a nation or kingdom and cause it to be strong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_10" data-id="JR18_10">But if the people of that nation start to do evil things and refuse to obey me, then I will not bless them as I said that I would do.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_11" data-id="JR18_11">Therefore, Jeremiah, go and warn all the people in Jerusalem and in other places in Judah. Say to them, 'This is what Yahweh says: I am planning a disaster that I will send to you. So, each of you should turn from your evil behavior and start doing what is right, in order that good things will come to you instead!'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_12" data-id="JR18_12">But the people will say back to you, 'It is useless for you to say these things to us. We will continue to be stubborn and behave as wickedly as we want to.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_13" data-id="JR18_13">So this is what Yahweh said in response:</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JR18_13" data-id="JR18_13">"Ask the people who live in other nations if they have ever heard of such a thing.</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_13" data-id="JR18_13">My Israelite people, who have been pure like virgins, have done a terrible thing!</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_14" data-id="JR18_14">The snow certainly never completely disappears from the rocky slopes of the mountains in Lebanon.</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_14" data-id="JR18_14">The cold streams that flow down from those distant mountains never cease flowing.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_15" data-id="JR18_15">But my people are not as reliable as those streams:</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_15" data-id="JR18_15">They have abandoned me.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JR18_15" data-id="JR18_15">They burn incense to honor worthless idols.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JR18_15" data-id="JR18_15">It is as though they have stumbled as they walked along well known and reliable roads</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_15" data-id="JR18_15">and now, instead, they are walking on dirt paths.</div>

<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_16" data-id="JR18_16">Therefore, their land will become desolate,</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_16" data-id="JR18_16">and people who see it will hiss to ridicule it from now on.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JR18_16" data-id="JR18_16">All the people who pass by will be appalled;</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_16" data-id="JR18_16">they will shake their heads to show that they are shocked.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_17" data-id="JR18_17">I will scatter the people when their enemies attack them</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_17" data-id="JR18_17">like dust is scattered by an east wind.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JR18_17" data-id="JR18_17">And when they experience all these disasters,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_17" data-id="JR18_17">I will turn my back on them and refuse to help them."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_18" data-id="JR18_18">Then the people said, "Come, we should plan to attack Jeremiah. We have many priests who teach us God's laws, wise men who give us good advice, and prophets who tell us what will happen. We do not need Jeremiah! So we should slander him and not pay attention to anything that he says."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_19" data-id="JR18_19">Then I prayed, "Yahweh, please listen to me!</span>

<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_19" data-id="JR18_19">And listen to what my enemies are saying about me.</div>

<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_20" data-id="JR18_20">so it is disgusting that they are paying me back by doing evil things to me.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JR18_20" data-id="JR18_20">It is as though they have dug a pit for me to fall into and die.</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR18_20" data-id="JR18_20">Do not forget that one time I stood in front of you and pleaded for you to help them,</div>

</div>
