<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_1" data-id="GN12_1">Then Yahweh said to Abram, "Leave this country where you are now living. Leave your father's clan and his family, and go to a land that I will show you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_2" data-id="GN12_2">I will cause your descendants to become a large nation. I will bless you and cause you to become famous. What I do for you will be a blessing to others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_3" data-id="GN12_3">I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who do evil things to you. I will bless all the clans on earth through you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_4" data-id="GN12_4">So Abram left Haran, as Yahweh told him to do. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left there along with his family and Lot's family.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_5" data-id="GN12_5">Abram took his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot; he also took with himself all the possessions and slaves that they had accumulated in Haran. They left from there and went to the land of Canaan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_6" data-id="GN12_6">In Canaan they traveled as far as Shechem and camped by a tall tree called the tree of Moreh. When this happened, the Canaanite people were living in that land.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_7" data-id="GN12_7">Then Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him, "I will give this land to your descendants." Then Abram built an altar to offer a sacrifice to Yahweh, who had appeared to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_8" data-id="GN12_8">From Shechem, Abram and his family traveled to the hills that were east of Bethel. Bethel was to the west of where they set up their tent, and Ai was to the east. There he built another altar and offered a sacrifice and worshiped Yahweh there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_9" data-id="GN12_9">Then they left there and continued traveling south to the Negev desert.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_10" data-id="GN12_10">There was a famine in that land, so they went further south to live for awhile in the land of Egypt, because the lack of food in the land where they were was very severe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_11" data-id="GN12_11">When they were coming near to the land of Egypt, Abram said to his wife Sarai, "Listen, I know that you are a very beautiful woman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_12" data-id="GN12_12">When the people in Egypt see you, they will say, 'This woman is his wife!' and they will kill me, but they will not kill you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_13" data-id="GN12_13">So I ask you to tell them that you are my sister, so that I will be safe and so they will spare my life because of you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_14" data-id="GN12_14">And that was what happened. As soon as they arrived in Egypt, the people in Egypt saw that his wife was indeed very beautiful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_15" data-id="GN12_15">When the king's officials saw her, they told the king how beautiful she was. Then the king took her into his palace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_16" data-id="GN12_16">The king treated Abram kindly because of Sarai, and he gave Abram sheep and cattle and donkeys and male and female slaves and camels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_17" data-id="GN12_17">But because the king had taken Sarai, Abram's wife, Yahweh caused the king and the others in his household to be inflicted with terrible diseases.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_18" data-id="GN12_18">So the king summoned Abram and said to him, "You have done a terrible thing to me! Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_19" data-id="GN12_19">Why did you say that she is your sister, so that I took her to be my wife? You should not have done that! So now take your wife, leave here and go!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_20" data-id="GN12_20">Then the king ordered his officials to take Abram and his wife and all his possessions out of Egypt.</span>
