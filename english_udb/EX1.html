<div class="mt">Exodus</div>
<div class="c">1</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_1" data-id="EX1_1">These were the sons of Jacob (they all went to the land of Egypt with Jacob, their father, and with their own households). The sons' names were:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_2" data-id="EX1_2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_3" data-id="EX1_3">Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_4" data-id="EX1_4">Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_5" data-id="EX1_5">In all, there were seventy people who went with Jacob. His son Joseph was already in Egypt.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_6" data-id="EX1_6">After some time, Joseph and his brothers and everyone else in their family who lived in that generation died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_7" data-id="EX1_7">But Jacob's descendants gave birth to many children. The number of his descendants grew very large. As a result, there were so many of them that they were everywhere in Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_8" data-id="EX1_8">However, many years later, a new king began to rule in Egypt. He did not know about all the good things Joseph had done for the people of Egypt long ago.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_9" data-id="EX1_9">He said to his people, "Look at what has happened! The Israelite people have become so many and so powerful that they are dangerous to us!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_10" data-id="EX1_10">We must find a way to control them! If we do not do that, there will be more of them. Then, if enemies attack us, the Israelites will join with our enemies and fight against us, and they will escape from our land."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_11" data-id="EX1_11">So the king and his leaders put masters over the Israelites to cause them to suffer very much by making them work very hard. They made the Israelite people build two cities to store goods for the king. Those cities were named Pithom and Rameses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_12" data-id="EX1_12">But the more they treated the Israelite people badly, the more the number of Israelites grew, and they became so many that they filled the land. So the Egyptian people began to fear the Israelite people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_13" data-id="EX1_13">They made the Israelite people work very hard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_14" data-id="EX1_14">Because the Israelites were slaves, their lives were very sad. They had to build many buildings with cement and bricks. They also had to do work in the fields. In making the Israelites do all this work, the Egyptian masters treated them very badly.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_15" data-id="EX1_15">Now there were two Hebrew midwives. Their names were Shiphrah and Puah. The king of Egypt said to those two women,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_16" data-id="EX1_16">"When you help the Hebrew women give birth to their children, if the baby is a boy, you must kill him. If the baby is a girl, you may let her live."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_17" data-id="EX1_17">But the midwives feared that God would punish them if they obeyed the king. So they did not do what the king told them to do. They allowed the baby boys to live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_18" data-id="EX1_18">So the king called the two midwives and said to them, "Why are you doing this? Why are you letting the baby boys live?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_19" data-id="EX1_19">One of the midwives said to the king, "The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. The Hebrew women are very strong. They give birth to their babies before we can get to them to help them."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_20" data-id="EX1_20">So God acted kindly toward the midwives, and the Hebrew people became very numerous and strong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_21" data-id="EX1_21">Because the midwives feared God, God gave them children of their own.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX1_22" data-id="EX1_22">Then the king commanded all the Egyptian people, saying, "You must throw into the Nile River every Hebrew baby boy that is born! However, you can allow the baby girls to live."</span>
