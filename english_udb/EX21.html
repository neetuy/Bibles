<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_2" data-id="EX21_2">When you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve you for only six years. In the seventh year you must free him from being your slave, and he does not have to pay you anything for setting him free.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_3" data-id="EX21_3">If he was not married before he became your slave, and if he marries someone while he is your slave, his wife is not to be set free with him. But if he was married before he became your slave, you must free both him and his wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_4" data-id="EX21_4">If the master of a slave gives him a wife, and she gives birth to sons or daughters while her husband is a slave, only the man is to be freed. His wife and children will continue to be slaves of their master.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_5" data-id="EX21_5">But when it is time for the slave to be set free, if the slave says, 'I love my master and my wife and my children, and I do not want to be set free,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_6" data-id="EX21_6">then his master must take him to the place where they worship God. There he must make the slave stand against the door or the doorpost. Then the master will use an awl to make a hole in the slave's ear and fasten something to the slave's ear to show that he will own that slave for the rest of his life.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_7" data-id="EX21_7">If a man sells his daughter to become a slave, she should not be set free after six years as the male slaves are.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_8" data-id="EX21_8">If the man who bought her wanted her to be his concubine, but if later he is not pleased with her, he must sell her back to her father. He must not sell her to a foreigner because that would be breaking the contract he made with the girl's father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_9" data-id="EX21_9">If the man who buys her wants her to be a wife for his son, he must then treat her as though she were his own daughter.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_11" data-id="EX21_11">If he does not do these three things for her, he must free her from being a slave, and she is not required to pay anything for being set free.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX21_14" data-id="EX21_14">But if someone gets angry with another person and kills him on purpose, even if the murderer runs to the altar, you must kill him.</span>
