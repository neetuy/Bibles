<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_1" data-id="T15_1">Do not speak harshly to a man older than yourself. Instead, advise him as if he were your father. Do the same to younger men as if they were your brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_2" data-id="T15_2">Advise older women as mothers, and younger women as if they were your sisters. You must act in a completely proper way as you do that.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_3" data-id="T15_3">Respect widows who are true widows.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_4" data-id="T15_4">But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn that they are to care for their own family first. They should repay their parents and grandparents for all that they did for them when they were young, because doing that pleases God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_5" data-id="T15_5">The widow who is really alone and have no one to help her confidently expects that God will help her. So night and day she prays and earnestly asks God to help her and others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_6" data-id="T15_6">But a widow who lives for how she can please herself is spiritually dead, even though she is still physically alive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_7" data-id="T15_7">You should announce these things so that no one can criticize the believers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_8" data-id="T15_8">If anyone does not take care of his own relatives, and especially those who live in his own house, he has rejected what we believe and we should consider that he is worse than a person who does not believe in the Messiah.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_9" data-id="T15_9">Put a woman on the list of true widows only if she is more than sixty years old. She also must have had only one husband, to whom she had been faithful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_10" data-id="T15_10">People must know that she does good deeds: Perhaps she cared for children well; perhaps she welcomed strangers; perhaps she helped the believers; perhaps she helped people who were suffering; or perhaps she is known for doing a large variety of good things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_11" data-id="T15_11">But do not put younger widows on the widows' list, because they often want to marry again when they change their minds and put married love ahead of the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_12" data-id="T15_12">When they do this, then they become guilty of going back on their prior commitment to being widows.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_13" data-id="T15_13">At the same time, they also go from house to house and get into the habit of doing nothing. In addition, they also begin to talk about people and to meddle in other people's affairs and to say things that they should not say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_14" data-id="T15_14">So I prefer that younger widows get married, have children, and manage their homes well, so they give Satan, the enemy, no opportunity to accuse them of doing wrong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_15" data-id="T15_15">I write these things because some younger widows have already stopped obeying the Messiah in order to obey Satan.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_16" data-id="T15_16">If any believing woman has widows among her relatives, let her help them, so those widows will not be a burden to the church. In this way the church will be able to help real widows.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_17" data-id="T15_17">Let the believers give double honor to the elders who lead them well, and especially to the elders who work hard at preaching and teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_18" data-id="T15_18">For the scripture says, "You shall not keep the ox from eating the grain that he is treading out" and "The laborer deserves to get his pay."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_19" data-id="T15_19">Do not listen to anyone who accuses an elder of doing wrong, unless two or three people testify about the matter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_20" data-id="T15_20">Those who continue to sin, correct them where everyone can see you, so that the rest of the people will be afraid to sin.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_21" data-id="T15_21">God and the Messiah Jesus and the chosen angels see me as I solemnly command you to do these things. Do not judge anyone before you should. Do not favor one person over another.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_22" data-id="T15_22">Do not be in a hurry to put your hands on a man to appoint him as an elder. God will consider that you are responsible if you approve as an elder a person who sins. You must keep yourself without fault.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_23" data-id="T15_23">No longer drink only water, Timothy. Instead, drink a little wine, because that may cure your frequent stomach sicknesses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_24" data-id="T15_24">The sins of some people are clear to everyone, which makes it easy to judge them. But the sins of other people are hidden until later.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_25" data-id="T15_25">In the same way, some good deeds are clear to everybody, but even the other good deeds will become clear at some time in the future.</span>
