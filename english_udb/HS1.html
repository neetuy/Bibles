<div class="section chapter HS HS1 english_udb eng " dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="HS1" data-nextid="HS2" data-previd="DN12"><br>
<div class="mt">Hosea</div>
<div class="c">1</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_1" data-id="HS1_1">Yahweh gave Hosea these messages during the years that Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah, and when Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_2" data-id="HS1_2">When Yahweh spoke for the first time through the prophet Hosea, he said, "Go and marry a prostitute. She will have children because she has given herself to other men. When you marry a prostitute, this will show how my people have been so shamefully unfaithful to me. It will show them how they have left me, their God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_3" data-id="HS1_3">So Hosea married Gomer, daughter of Diblaim. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_4" data-id="HS1_4">Yahweh said to Hosea, "Give your baby the name Jezreel, because I will soon punish the family members of King Jehu for the murders that he committed in the city of Jezreel. I will also bring the kingdom of Israel to an end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_5" data-id="HS1_5">On that day I will destroy the fighting strength of the army of Israel, there in the Valley of Jezreel."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_6" data-id="HS1_6">Gomer soon became pregnant again, and this time she gave birth to a daughter. Then Yahweh spoke to him, "Give her the name Lo-Ruhamah, which means 'no mercy,' because I will no longer have any mercy for the people of Israel, and I will not forgive them for even one sin they have committed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_7" data-id="HS1_7">But I will have mercy on the people of Judah. I will save them—but not by deadly weapons, the bow, the sword, or battle. I will not save them by armies or by strong horses and those who ride on them. Instead, I, Yahweh myself, will save them."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_8" data-id="HS1_8">After Gomer had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_9" data-id="HS1_9">Yahweh said "Give him the name Lo-Ammi, which means 'not my people,' because you, O Israel, are not my people—and I will no longer protect you as your God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_10" data-id="HS1_10">One day in the future, the people of Israel will be as numerous as the grains of sand by the sea. No one will be able to count them. I have said to Israel, 'You are not my people,'—but one day I will say to them, 'You are the people whom I will protect and love.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_11" data-id="HS1_11">On that day I, Yahweh, will gather all the people of Judah and bring them together with all the people of Israel. They will choose from among themselves a single leader, and they will go out of that land in which they were held as exiles. On that day they will say, 'Great is the day of Jezreel!' (Jezreel means, 'God plants his people in his land.')</span>
