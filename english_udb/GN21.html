<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_1" data-id="GN21_1">Yahweh acted very kindly toward Sarah, just as he said he would do. He did for Sarah exactly what he promised to do,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_2" data-id="GN21_2">for she became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham when he was very old, at the time God promised it would happen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_3" data-id="GN21_3">Abraham gave the name "Isaac" to the son Sarah delivered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_4" data-id="GN21_4">He also circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, just as God had commanded him to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_5" data-id="GN21_5">Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_6" data-id="GN21_6">Sarah said, "Although I was sad before because I did not have any children, God has now enabled me to laugh with joy, and everyone who hears about what God has done for me will laugh with me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_7" data-id="GN21_7">She also said, "No one would have said to Abraham that some day I would nurse a child, but I have given birth to a son when Abraham is very old."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_8" data-id="GN21_8">The baby grew. The day came when he was taken off his mother's milk. On that day, Abraham prepared a large feast to celebrate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_9" data-id="GN21_9">One day Sarah noticed that Hagar's son Ishmael was making fun of Isaac.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_10" data-id="GN21_10">So she said to Abraham, "Get rid of that slave woman from Egypt and her son! I do not want the son of that slave woman to take what my son Isaac will inherit."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_11" data-id="GN21_11">Abraham was very upset about the matter, because he was also concerned about his son Ishmael.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_12" data-id="GN21_12">But God said to Abraham, "Do not be upset about your son, Ishmael, and about your servant Hagar. Listen to everything that Sarah tells you to do, and do it, because Isaac is the one who will be the forefather of the descendants I promised to give you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_13" data-id="GN21_13">But I will also cause the son of your servant Hagar to be the ancestor of a great people group, because he is also your son."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_14" data-id="GN21_14">So Abraham got up early the next morning. He got some food ready, put water in a bag, and gave it to Hagar. He put the bag on her shoulder, handed her Ishmael, and sent them away into the wilderness of Beersheba.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_15" data-id="GN21_15">After Hagar and her son had drunk all the water in the bag, she put the boy under one of the bushes there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_16" data-id="GN21_16">Then she went and sat nearby, about as far as someone can shoot an arrow. She thought, "I cannot endure seeing my son die!" As she sat there, she began to cry loudly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_17" data-id="GN21_17">Soon God heard the sound of Ishmael, so he sent one of his angels to call out from heaven to Hagar. He said, "Hagar, what is the matter with you? Do not be afraid, because God has heard the boy crying there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_18" data-id="GN21_18">Go lift the boy up and help him be brave, because I will cause his descendants to become a great people group."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_19" data-id="GN21_19">Then God showed her a well of water. So she went to the well and filled the container with water, and gave the boy a drink.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_20" data-id="GN21_20">God helped the boy as he grew up in the wilderness, and he became a good archer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_21" data-id="GN21_21">He lived in the wilderness of Paran. Hagar got a wife for him from Egypt.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_22" data-id="GN21_22">At that time, King Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, "It is clear that God helps you in all that you do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_23" data-id="GN21_23">So now, solemnly promise to me here, as God is listening, that you will not deceive me and my children, or my descendants. Act faithfully toward me and toward all the people here in the country where you are now living. Act faithfully toward me, as I have acted toward you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_24" data-id="GN21_24">So Abraham swore an oath to do that.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_25" data-id="GN21_25">Abraham also complained to Abimelech about one of Abraham's wells of water that Abimelech's servants had taken control of.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_26" data-id="GN21_26">But Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done that. You did not tell me previously, and I did not hear about it until today."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_27" data-id="GN21_27">So Abraham brought some sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them solemnly agreed to have peace between themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_28" data-id="GN21_28">Abraham went to his flock and chose seven female lambs from it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_29" data-id="GN21_29">Abimelech asked Abraham, "Why have you taken these seven female lambs from your flock?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_30" data-id="GN21_30">Abraham replied, "I want you to accept these female lambs from me. In this way, my gift to you will be proof to everyone that this well belongs to me because I dug it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_31" data-id="GN21_31">So Abimelech accepted the lambs. Then Abraham named that place Beersheba, which means 'Well of the oath,' because he and Abimelech had sworn an oath there to be peaceful toward each other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_32" data-id="GN21_32">After they made the treaty at Beersheba, Abimelech and his army commander, Phicol, left and returned to the land of the Philistines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_33" data-id="GN21_33">Abraham planted a tamarisk tree there, and there he worshiped Yahweh, the eternal God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_34" data-id="GN21_34">Abraham stayed as an outsider in the land of the Philistine people for a long time.</span>
