<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV13_3" data-id="LV13_3">The priest must examine that part of the person's skin. If the hair in that area has become white and it appears that the sore is deeper than just on the skin, then it is a skin disease that other people are in danger of receiving from him. If that is what the priest sees, he must declare that this sick person is not fit to be with other people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV13_4" data-id="LV13_4">If the spot on the person's skin is white but it does not appear that the sore is deeper than the surface of the skin, the priest must keep him away from all other people for seven days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV13_5" data-id="LV13_5">After seven days, the priest must examine the person again. If the priest sees that the sore has not changed and has not spread, he must keep the person away from people for yet another seven days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV13_6" data-id="LV13_6">Again, after those seven more days have passed, the priest must examine the person once more. If the sore has faded and has not spread, the priest will declare that the person is fit to be with other people again. His skin condition is only a rash; it is not contagious. After the person washes his clothes, the priest will allow him to be with other people again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV13_7" data-id="LV13_7">But if the sore spreads after the priest has examined him, the person must go to the priest again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV13_8" data-id="LV13_8">The priest will examine him; if the sore has spread to more of the skin, it is a contagious skin disease, and the priest will declare that the person is not fit to be with other people.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV13_11" data-id="LV13_11">then it is a permanent skin disease; the priest will declare that the person is not fit to be with other people. The priest does not need to keep that person away from others for seven days in order to examine him again, because he already knows that the person is unfit to be with others.</span>
