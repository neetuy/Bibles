<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_2" data-id="R229_2">Hezekiah did things that Yahweh considered to be right, like his ancestor King David had done.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_3" data-id="R229_3">During the first month of the first year that Hezekiah was ruling Judah, he unlocked the doors of the temple, and his workers repaired them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_4" data-id="R229_4">Then he gathered the priests and other descendants of Levi in the courtyard on the east side of the temple,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_5" data-id="R229_5">and he said to them, "You descendants of Levi, listen to me! Set yourselves apart, and prepare the house of Yahweh so it is a place that honors Yahweh, whom your ancestors worshiped; carry out all the filthiness that is in the holy place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_6" data-id="R229_6">Our ancestors disobeyed God; they did many things that he says are evil, and they did things that are not pleasing to him.

<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_7" data-id="R229_7">They locked the doors of the temple and extinguished the lamps. They did not burn any incense, and they did not offer any sacrifices that were to be completely burned on the altar in the holy place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_8" data-id="R229_8">Therefore, Yahweh has become very angry with us people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah, and he has caused other people to become frightened and horrified of us. And they ridicule us. You know this very well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_9" data-id="R229_9">That is why our fathers have been killed in battles, and our sons and daughters and our wives have been captured and taken to other countries.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_10" data-id="R229_10">But now I intend to make a covenant with Yahweh, our God, in order that he will no longer be angry with us.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_19" data-id="R229_19">Ahaz ruled over us, he disobeyed what Yahweh had commanded, and he threw away many of the tools and implements from the temple many things that should be there, but now we have brought them back, we dedicated them to Yahweh's service, and then we placed them in front of the altar of Yahweh, where they can be seen."</span>

<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_20" data-id="R229_20">Early the next morning, King Hezekiah gathered together the city officials, and they went to the courtyard of the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_21" data-id="R229_21">They took with them seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs, and seven male goats to be an offering in order that Yahweh would forgive the sins of all the people in the kingdom of Judah, and in order to purify the temple. The king commanded that the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, should offer those animals to be sacrifices to Yahweh on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_22" data-id="R229_22">So first the priests slaughtered those bulls, and took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar.

<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_24" data-id="R229_24">Then the priests slaughtered those goats and splashed their blood on the altar, to atone for the sins of Israel.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_31" data-id="R229_31">Then Hezekiah said, "You have now set yourselves apart for the honor of Yahweh. So come close to the temple and bring animals to be sacrificed, and also bring the other offerings to thank Yahweh for what he has done for you." Then those who wanted to bring animals to be completely burned on the altar brought them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_32" data-id="R229_32">Altogether they brought seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred male lambs to be completely burned on the altar.</span>
