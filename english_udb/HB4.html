<div class="section chapter HB HB4 english_udb eng " dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="HB4" data-nextid="HB5" data-previd="HB3"><br>
<div class="c">4</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_1" data-id="HB4_1">God has promised that we would rest, but we must be careful, because we can miss God's place of rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_2" data-id="HB4_2">We have heard the good news about how Jesus gives us God's rest, just as the Israelites heard God promise that they would rest in Canaan. But just as that message did not help many Israelites because they did not trust God as Joshua and Caleb did, the good news about the Messiah will not help us if we do not trust God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">We who have believed in the Messiah are able to enter the place of rest because God said,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">"Because I was angry with the people of Israel, I solemnly declared, 'They will not enter the land where I would let them rest.'"</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">God said this even though his plans had been finished from the time he created the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_4" data-id="HB4_4">What was written in the scriptures about the seventh day after he had spent six days creating the world, shows that this is true:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_4" data-id="HB4_4">"Then, on the seventh day, God rested from his work of creating everything."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_5" data-id="HB4_5">But note again what God said about the Israelites in the passage that I quoted previously:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_5" data-id="HB4_5">"They will not enter the land where I would let them rest."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_6" data-id="HB4_6">Some people still enter God's rest. But the Israelites who first heard God promise that they would rest—they did not enter that place of resting, because they refused to believe God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_7" data-id="HB4_7">But God set another time when we may enter that place of resting. That time is now! We know that is true because much later than when the Israelites rebelled against God in the desert, he caused King David to write what I have already quoted,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_7" data-id="HB4_7">"Right now, when you understand what God is saying to you, do not stubbornly disobey him."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_8" data-id="HB4_8">If Joshua had led the Israelites to enter the only place of resting God would give them, then much later God would not have spoken again about another day of rest. But he did give them another promise of rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_9" data-id="HB4_9">So, just as God rested on the seventh day after he finished creating everything, there remains a time when God's people will rest eternally.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_10" data-id="HB4_10">Whoever enters God's place of resting has ceased from his work, just as God finished doing his work of creating everything.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_11" data-id="HB4_11">So we eagerly enter into the rest of God by following the Messiah, so that the example of those who disobey will not influence us and ruin us too.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_12" data-id="HB4_12">God's words are alive and powerful, and they are able to cut like a sharp sword—cutting so deep that it can separate out the difference between our soul and our spirit. God's words are just like a sword that cuts deeply, down so deep they can cut into us like a sharp sword cuts through the joints of an animal. Those words cut even into the hardest places in us, like a sword that can cut down into the marrow within the bones. God's words are like a judge, deciding what thoughts are good or what thoughts are bad, and his words test the motives hidden deep within each of our hearts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_13" data-id="HB4_13">God knows everything about everyone. Nothing is hidden from him. Everything is completely open to him and he sees everything we do. We must all appear before God and we must tell him how we have lived our lives.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_14" data-id="HB4_14">So we have a great high priest who ascended through the heavens when he returned to God's presence. He is Jesus, God's Son. So let us courageously say openly that we trust Jesus the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_15" data-id="HB4_15">Our high priest can indeed have mercy on us and encourage us, we who tend to sin easily, because Satan also tempted him to sin in every way that he tempts us to sin—but he did not sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_16" data-id="HB4_16">So let us come boldly to the Messiah, who rules from heaven and does for us what we do not deserve, so that he might kindly help us and have mercy on us when we need him to do so.</span>
