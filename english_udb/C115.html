<div class="c">15</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_1" data-id="C115_1">And now I wish to remind you, brothers and sisters, about the good news I proclaimed to you. You believed this message and now you live according to it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_2" data-id="C115_2">This good news saved you, as long as you hold firmly to it—unless you did not truly believe it.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_3" data-id="C115_3">For I have passed on to you what others first told me, that the Messiah died for our sins, as the scripture foretold he would;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_4" data-id="C115_4">also that they buried him, and that God raised him to life on the third day, all just the way the scriptures said it would happen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_5" data-id="C115_5">Then the Messiah appeared to Cephas (known as Peter), and then he appeared to the rest of the apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_6" data-id="C115_6">He later appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters in the Lord when they were all together. Some of them have since died, but most are still alive and can verify this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_7" data-id="C115_7">Then he appeared to James, and then again to all the apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_8" data-id="C115_8">Last of all he appeared to me, although I am very unlike the other apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_9" data-id="C115_9">For I am the least of the apostles. I made the church of the Messiah suffer greatly, so I do not deserve to be an apostle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_10" data-id="C115_10">But God has been very kind to me, so I am an apostle, and he has done much good through me. Really, I have worked harder than all the other apostles. Still, it was not really I who worked, but God, who gave me the strength.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_11" data-id="C115_11">So whether it is the other apostles or I who preached to you, we proclaimed the good news about the Messiah, and you believed us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_12" data-id="C115_12">Now some of you are saying that those who are now dead will not rise anymore. This cannot be true, because we have announced to you that the Messiah rose from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_13" data-id="C115_13">If no one rises from the dead, then God certainly has not raised the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_14" data-id="C115_14">And if he has not raised the Messiah from the dead, then what we preach makes no sense at all, and what you believe about the Messiah can do nothing for you in your life or in your death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_15" data-id="C115_15">In addition, people will see that we have told lies about God, if the dead really do not rise again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_16" data-id="C115_16">Again I say, if no one rises from the dead, then God has not even raised the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_17" data-id="C115_17">And if he has not raised the Messiah, then what you believe is useless, and God still condemns you because you have sinned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_18" data-id="C115_18">If that is the case, then all those who have died trusting in the Messiah have also died with no hope of resurrection.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_19" data-id="C115_19">If in this life only we have hope in the Messiah, and we expect him to do nothing for us after we die, then of all people we most deserve the pity of others, for we have believed in a lie.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_20" data-id="C115_20">But in fact, God has raised the Messiah from the dead, and he is only the first of the many people that he will raise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_21" data-id="C115_21">For everyone in the world dies because of what one man, Adam, did. However, those who have died will live again—also because of what one person has done; that is, the man the Messiah Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_22" data-id="C115_22">Because, just as all die because Adam sinned, in the same way, all will live again because of what the Messiah has done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_23" data-id="C115_23">But they will rise from the dead in a certain order: the Messiah is the first to have risen from the dead; then those who are joined to the Messiah will live again when he returns to earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_24" data-id="C115_24">Then the world will come to an end, when the Messiah will present all the world to God the Father, for him to rule. This is when the Messiah will bring to an end all who have the status of rulers, and everything that has reigning authority and all seats of power in this world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_25" data-id="C115_25">For the Messiah must rule until God has conquered every one of his enemies, and placed them under the Messiah's feet to show that they have no more power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_26" data-id="C115_26">The final enemy that God will destroy is death itself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_27" data-id="C115_27">For the scriptures say, "God has placed everything under his feet," that is, the Messiah's feet. But it is clear that this does not include God himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_28" data-id="C115_28">After God has placed all things into the Messiah's power, then the Son also will place himself in the power of God the Father, so that God may be the same in relation to everyone and everything.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_29" data-id="C115_29">If there is no resurrection from the dead, as some say, then there is no reason for people to receive baptism for the sake of those who have died, as some do. If God does not bring any dead people back to life, then here is no reason for living people to receive baptism for the sake of those who have died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_30" data-id="C115_30">And we apostles would have no reason to risk our lives every day, as we do, to proclaim the good news if there is no resurrection from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_31" data-id="C115_31">My brothers and sisters, I am so proud of you; you are like my possessions that I show off to the Messiah Jesus our Lord. Every day I am in danger of dying!</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_32" data-id="C115_32">If God will not raise the dead, then I fought with those wild animals at Ephesus for nothing. What the poets wrote would in that case be true: "Let us eat food and drink wine today, because we will die tomorrow."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_33" data-id="C115_33">Do not be tricked: "If you have bad friends, you will not care to live any longer in the right way."</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_34" data-id="C115_34">Sober up! Live in the right way and do not keep sinning. Some of you do not know God at all. I say this to shame you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_35" data-id="C115_35">Someone may ask you, "How can the dead rise? What kind of body could they ever have?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_36" data-id="C115_36">You know nothing! You do not think about the fact that any seed you plant in the ground will not start to grow until it dies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_37" data-id="C115_37">And what a farmer plants does not look the same as what will come up. It is only a bare seed; it will change into something entirely different.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_38" data-id="C115_38">God will give it a new body just as he chooses, and to each seed put into the ground he will give a different body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_39" data-id="C115_39">Not all living creatures are the same. There are human beings, and there are animals on the land of many kinds, and there are the birds and fish. All of them are different.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_40" data-id="C115_40">There are also different kinds of things in the heavens. The nature of those bodies in the sky is different from the nature of the things on this world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_41" data-id="C115_41">There is one kind of the nature for the bright sun, and another kind for the softer moon. There is still another kind of nature for the stars, but the stars all differ one from another in many ways.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_42" data-id="C115_42">It is the same way when people rise from the dead. What goes into the ground has died, but what rises will never die again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_43" data-id="C115_43">When it goes into the ground, it is in the dirt, but when God raises it again, it grows with honor and power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_44" data-id="C115_44">What goes into the ground belongs to this earth, but what rises from the dead has God's power. So, there are things that belong to this earth, and there are things that have God's power, which lasts forever.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_45" data-id="C115_45">So the scriptures say, "The first man, Adam, was a living being who gave his children and descendants life." But the Messiah, the second Adam, gave people God's power to live forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_46" data-id="C115_46">What belongs to the earth came first, the natural, and then came what belongs to God, that is the spiritual.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_47" data-id="C115_47">The first man, Adam, belonged to the earth, for he was made from dust. But the second man, the Messiah, belongs to heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_48" data-id="C115_48">All those who are made from dust are just like Adam, the one who was made from dust. All those who belong to heaven are just like the Messiah, the man from heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_49" data-id="C115_49">Just as God made us like the man who was made from dust, so he will also make us be like the man from heaven.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_50" data-id="C115_50">Now I say this, brothers and sisters, human beings who will die cannot obtain the things that God promises to give all those whom he rules. It is just as the things that die cannot become things that do not die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_51" data-id="C115_51">Look! I tell you something that God has hidden from us. Not all believers will die, but God will change all of us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_52" data-id="C115_52">He will change us in an instant, as fast as one can blink his eye, when God's angels blow the final trumpet. For they will blow that trumpet and then God will raise the dead so as to never die again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53 " data-id="bibleJsn">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_53" data-id="C115_53">For it is these bodies that will die, but God will make them live forever, never to die again, and it is these bodies that now can be destroyed, but God will make them new, never to die again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54 " data-id="bibleJsn">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_54" data-id="C115_54">When this happens, then it will come true, what the scriptures say:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C115_54" data-id="C115_54">"God has totally defeated death."</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-55 " data-id="bibleJsn">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_55" data-id="C115_55">"Death will never win again!</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C115_55" data-id="C115_55">The pain of dying has been taken away!"</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-56 " data-id="bibleJsn">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_56" data-id="C115_56">It is sin that brings such pain to us when we are dying. And sin's power comes into our lives because of the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57 " data-id="bibleJsn">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_57" data-id="C115_57">But now we thank God because he gives us victory over death through our Lord Jesus the Messiah!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-58 " data-id="bibleJsn">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_58" data-id="C115_58">Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, be solid in your faith, unmoveable in your life, doing more and more in the Lord's work. You know that whatever you do for him will last forever.</span>
