<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_1" data-id="EX36_1">Bezalel and Oholiab will take up this work along with all the other gifted men to whom Yahweh had given skills and the understanding to do all the work needed to build up the sacred tent. These men followed all the instructions that Yahweh gave them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_2" data-id="EX36_2">So Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and all the other skilled men to whom Yahweh had given special ability and who wanted to do some of the work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_3" data-id="EX36_3">Moses gave them all the things that the people had brought as offerings to Yahweh for making the sacred tent. But the people continued bringing more things every morning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_4" data-id="EX36_4">As a result, the men who were doing various things to make the sacred tent came to Moses, each of them what Yahweh commanded them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_5" data-id="EX36_5">So the craftsmen said to Moses, "The people are bringing more than we need to do the work that Yahweh has commanded us!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_6" data-id="EX36_6">So Moses gave them a message that others proclaimed throughout the camp, saying "No one should bring anything more as an offering to make the sacred tent!" When the people heard that, they did not bring anything more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_7" data-id="EX36_7">What they had already brought was enough to do all the work. In fact, it was more than was needed!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_8" data-id="EX36_8">All the most skilled men among the workmen made the sacred tent. They made it from ten strips of fine linen, and they carefully embroidered it using blue, purple, and red woolen yarn to make figures that resembled the winged creatures. Bezalel designed all this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_9" data-id="EX36_9">Each strip was twelve and four-fifths meters long and one and four-fifths meters wide.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_10" data-id="EX36_10">Bezalel and his men sewed five strips together to make one set, and they sewed the other five strips together to make the other set.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_11" data-id="EX36_11">For each set, Bezalel and his men made loops of blue cloth and fastened them on the outer edge of the strip, at the end of each set.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_12" data-id="EX36_12">They put 50 loops on the edge of the first set, and 50 loops on the edge of the second set.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_13" data-id="EX36_13">They made 50 gold fasteners to attach both of the sets together. In that way, the inside of the sacred tent was as though it were one piece.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_14" data-id="EX36_14">Bezalel and his men made a cover for the sacred tent from 11 pieces of cloth made from goats' hair.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_15" data-id="EX36_15">Each piece of cloth was eighteen and one-third meters long and one and four-fifths meters wide.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_16" data-id="EX36_16">They sewed five of these pieces of cloth together to make one set, and they sewed the other six pieces of cloth together to make another set.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_17" data-id="EX36_17">They made one hundred loops of blue cloth. They fastened fifty of them to the outer edge of the one set and they fastened fifty to the outer edge of the other set.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_18" data-id="EX36_18">Bezalel and his men made 50 bronze clasps and joined the two sets together with them. In that way it formed one cover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_19" data-id="EX36_19">They made two more covers for the sacred tent. They made one from rams' skins that had been tanned, and they made the top cover from goatskin leather.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_20" data-id="EX36_20">Bezalel and his men made forty-eight frames from acacia wood and set them up to support the covers for the sacred tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_21" data-id="EX36_21">Each frame was four and three-fifths meters long and three-quarters of a meter wide.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_22" data-id="EX36_22">They made two projections at the bottom of each frame. These were for fastening the frames to the bases underneath them. Each frame had these projections.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_23" data-id="EX36_23">The skilled workmen made twenty frames for the south side of the sacred tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_24" data-id="EX36_24">Bezalel and his men made forty silver bases to go underneath them. Two bases went under each frame. The projections on each frame fit into these bases.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_25" data-id="EX36_25">Similarly, they made twenty frames for the north side of the sacred tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_26" data-id="EX36_26">They also made forty silver bases for them with two bases under each frame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_27" data-id="EX36_27">For the rear of the sacred tent, on the west side, Bezalel and his men made six frames.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_28" data-id="EX36_28">They also made two extra frames, one for each corner of the rear of the sacred tent, to provide extra support.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_29" data-id="EX36_29">The two corner frames were separate from each other at the bottom but joined together at the top. At the top of each of the two corner frames, Bezalel and his men fastened a gold ring for holding the crossbar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_30" data-id="EX36_30">In that way, for the rear of the sacred tent there were eight frames, and there were 16 bases, two bases under each frame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX36_31" data-id="EX36_31">Bezalel and his men made 15 crossbars from acacia wood. Five of them were for the frames on the north side of the sacred tent,</span>
