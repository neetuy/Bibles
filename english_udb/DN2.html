<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_1" data-id="DN2_1">One night during the second year that Nebuchadnezzar ruled, he had a dream. The dream worried him so much that he could not sleep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_2" data-id="DN2_2">The next morning he summoned his men who worked magic, those who claimed to speak with the dead, those who gave advice from watching the stars, and the wise men. To test their skill, he demanded that they tell him what he had dreamed. They came and stood before the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_3" data-id="DN2_3">The king said, "I had a dream last night that worries me and I want to know what the dream means."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_4" data-id="DN2_4">The men who studied the stars replied to the king, (what follows is written in the Aramaic language). They said, "King Nebuchadnezzar, may you live forever! Tell us your dream and we will tell you what it means!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_5" data-id="DN2_5">But the king replied to them, "I have decided that you must tell me the dream and also tell me what it means. If you do not do this, I will cut you into pieces and turn your houses into piles of dung!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_6" data-id="DN2_6">But if you tell me what I dreamed and what it means, I will reward you. I will give you gifts and a reward and great honor. So tell me what I dreamed and what it means."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_7" data-id="DN2_7">Again they replied, "Tell us what you dreamed, and we will tell you what it means."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_8" data-id="DN2_8">The king replied, "I know that you are just trying to get more time because you know that I will do to you what I said that I would do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_9" data-id="DN2_9">If you do not tell me what I dreamed, you know what I promised to do to you. I think that you have all agreed to tell me lies and other wicked things before your time is up. So then, you have only one choice. Tell me the dream, and I will know you can tell me what it means."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_10" data-id="DN2_10">The wise men replied to the king, "There is no one on the earth who can do what you ask! There is no king, even a great and mighty king, who has ever asked his astrologers or those who claim to speak with the dead, or wise men like ourselves to do something like that!</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_11" data-id="DN2_11">What you are asking us to do is impossible. Only the gods can tell you what you dreamed, and they do not live among us!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_12" data-id="DN2_12">The king was very angry when he heard that, so he commanded his soldiers that they execute all men who were known for their wisdom in all of Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_13" data-id="DN2_13">According to the king's command, they set out to find Daniel and his friends, to execute them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_14" data-id="DN2_14">Arioch, the commander of the king's guards, came with soldiers to kill everyone in Babylon who was considered to be wise. So Daniel spoke to him very wisely and tactfully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_15" data-id="DN2_15">Daniel asked the captain Arioch, "Why has the king made a decree that must be carried out so quickly?" So Arioch told Daniel all that had happened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_16" data-id="DN2_16">Daniel went to talk with the king and requested an appointment with the king so that he could tell the king what the dream was and what it meant.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_17" data-id="DN2_17">Daniel went to his house and he told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah what had happened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_18" data-id="DN2_18">He urged them to ask God, who lives in heaven, to help them by telling them the secret of the dream of the king so that they and the other men in Babylon known for wisdom would not be put to death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_19" data-id="DN2_19">That night God gave Daniel a vision, and in that vision the secret was made known to him. Then Daniel praised God</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_20" data-id="DN2_20">saying,</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v DN2_20" data-id="DN2_20">"We praise the name of the true God forever</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v DN2_20" data-id="DN2_20">because he owns all wisdom and power.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_21" data-id="DN2_21">He makes the time move forward, and he owns the seasons.</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v DN2_21" data-id="DN2_21">He removes every king when he chooses and gives new kings their kingdom.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v DN2_21" data-id="DN2_21">He gives wisdom to some, and people become wise.</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v DN2_21" data-id="DN2_21">He teaches knowledge to those who understand.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_22" data-id="DN2_22">He reveals to us things that are deep and hidden.</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v DN2_22" data-id="DN2_22">He can do this because he knows everything that the darkness hides from us,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v DN2_22" data-id="DN2_22">and because the light comes from where he lives.</div>
</span>
<div class="q1">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_23" data-id="DN2_23">God, whom my ancestors worshiped,</span>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v DN2_23" data-id="DN2_23">I thank you and I praise you</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v DN2_23" data-id="DN2_23">because you have caused me to be wise and made me strong.</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v DN2_23" data-id="DN2_23">You have told me what my friends and I asked you to tell us,</div>
</span>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v DN2_23" data-id="DN2_23">and you have revealed to us what the king demanded to know."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_24" data-id="DN2_24">Then Daniel went to Arioch, the man whom the king had appointed to execute everyone known to be wise in Babylon. He said to him, "Do not kill those men of wisdom. Take me to the king and I will tell him what his dream means."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_25" data-id="DN2_25">So Arioch quickly took Daniel to the king. He said to the king, "I have found one of the men whom we brought from Judah who can tell you what your dream means!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_26" data-id="DN2_26">The king said to Daniel (whose name was now Belteshazzar), "Can you tell me what I dreamed and what it means?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_27" data-id="DN2_27">Daniel replied, "There is no one to help, even those who claim to be wise and those who claim to consult with the dead. No one can help, none of the magicians or astrologers. None of these can discover the secrets of your dream.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_28" data-id="DN2_28">But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has shown in your dream what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you what you dreamed and the vision you saw as you were lying on your bed.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_29" data-id="DN2_29">O king, while you were sleeping, you dreamed about events that will happen in the future. The one who reveals mysteries has shown you what is going to happen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_30" data-id="DN2_30">It is not because I am wiser than anyone else on earth that I know the meaning of this mysterious dream. It is because God wanted you to understand your deep thoughts hidden in the vision he gave you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_31" data-id="DN2_31">O king, in your vision you saw in front of you a huge and terrifying statue of a man. It was shining very brightly, and it was frightening and awesome.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_32" data-id="DN2_32">The head of the statue was made of pure gold. Its chest and arms were made of silver. Its belly and thighs were made of bronze.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_33" data-id="DN2_33">Its legs were made of iron and its feet were a mixture of clay and iron.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_34" data-id="DN2_34">As you watched, someone cut a stone from a mountain, but it was not a human who cut it. The stone tumbled down and smashed the statue's feet that were made of iron and clay. It smashed them to bits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_35" data-id="DN2_35">Then the rest of the statue collapsed into a big heap of iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold. The pieces of the statue were as small as bits of chaff on the ground where it is threshed, and the wind blew away all the tiny pieces. There was nothing left. But the stone that smashed the statue became a large mountain that covered the whole earth.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_36" data-id="DN2_36">That was what you dreamed. Now we will tell you what it means.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_37" data-id="DN2_37">You are a king who rules over other kings. The God who rules in heaven has caused you to rule over them and has given you great power and has honored you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_38" data-id="DN2_38">He has caused you to be the ruler over all people so that even the animals and birds belong to you. You are the head of the statue, that head made of gold.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_39" data-id="DN2_39">After your kingdom ends, there will be another great kingdom, but it will not be as great as yours. The silver parts of the statue represent that kingdom. Then there will be a third great kingdom whose king will rule over the whole earth. The bronze parts of the statue represent that third kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_40" data-id="DN2_40">After that kingdom ends, there will be a fourth great kingdom. The iron parts of the statue represent that kingdom. The army of that kingdom will smash the previous kingdoms, just like iron smashes everything that it strikes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_41" data-id="DN2_41">The feet and toes of the statue that you saw were a mixture of iron and clay, showing that the kingdom they represent will later be divided.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_42" data-id="DN2_42">Some parts of that kingdom will be as strong as iron, but some parts will not remain together, just as iron and clay do not stay together when mixed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_43" data-id="DN2_43">The mixture of iron and clay in the statue also means that this kingdom will come apart, because the different people groups will not work together, just as clay does not stick to iron.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_44" data-id="DN2_44">But while those kings are ruling, God who rules in heaven will establish a kingdom that will never end. No one will ever defeat its king. He will completely destroy all those kingdoms, but his kingdom will remain forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_45" data-id="DN2_45">That is the meaning of the stone that someone cut from the mountain, the stone that will crush to tiny bits the statue that is made of iron, bronze, silver, and gold. God, the great God, has told you what will happen in the future. The dream he gave you will come true. Its meaning is true, as I have told it to you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_46" data-id="DN2_46">Then King Nebuchadnezzar lay down on the ground in front of Daniel as an act of great respect. He commanded his people to burn incense and to burn an offering of grain in honor of Daniel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_47" data-id="DN2_47">The king said to Daniel, "Your God has enabled you to tell me the meaning of this dream, so now I truly know that your God is greater than all the other gods, and King over all other kings. He reveals secrets; he makes known mysteries no one else could know."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_48" data-id="DN2_48">Then the king gave many gifts to Daniel, and he also appointed him to rule over the entire province of Babylon. He made him to be the chief governor over all the wisest men in Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN2_49" data-id="DN2_49">Daniel asked the king to appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to serve in important positions as administrators in the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained in the king's palace and served the king there.</span>
