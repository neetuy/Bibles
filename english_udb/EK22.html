<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_2" data-id="EK22_2">"Son of man, are you ready to condemn the people of Jerusalem? It is a city full of murderers. Remind them of all the detestable things that they have done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_3" data-id="EK22_3">Then say, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: By murdering people and by defiling yourselves, by making idols, you people of this city have brought on yourselves the time when I will destroy you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_4" data-id="EK22_4">You have become guilty by murdering innocent people. You have made it impossible for me to accept you, by making idols for yourselves. You are bringing your time to an end. Therefore I will cause the other people groups to laugh at you and mock you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_5" data-id="EK22_5">People in countries that are near you and people who live far from you will make fun of you, because your city is full of confusion, and because you have made it impossible for me, your own God, to accept you.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_6" data-id="EK22_6">Think about how each of your Israelite kings have used his power to murder people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_7" data-id="EK22_7">Your people do not respect their parents; they have oppressed foreigners; they mistreat orphans and widows.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_8" data-id="EK22_8">You despise my sacred places and practices, and you treat the Sabbath days like any other day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_9" data-id="EK22_9">Among you are men who tell lies in order to cause others to be executed. There are those who go to the hilltops and eat food offered to idols, and they openly perform evil acts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_10" data-id="EK22_10">There are men who sleep with their father's wife, and men who sleep with women during their monthly menstrual periods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_11" data-id="EK22_11">There are men who sleep with someone else's wife. Some of your men sleep with their daughters-in-law or with their own sisters or half-sisters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_12" data-id="EK22_12">There are among you men who accept bribes in order to cause someone to be executed.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_13" data-id="EK22_13">So I will shake my fist at your unfair profits and at the murderers who live among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_14" data-id="EK22_14">When I finish punishing you, you will no longer be courageous. I, Yahweh, have said what I will do to you, and I will do it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_15" data-id="EK22_15">I will scatter you among many people groups, and I will make you stop your sinful behavior.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_19" data-id="EK22_19">Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: Because you have all become like dross, I will gather you in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_20" data-id="EK22_20">People put ore containing silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin in a very hot furnace and melt them in a blazing fire to burn up the impurities. Similarly, I will gather you together inside Jerusalem, and because I am very angry with you, what I will do will be as though I am melting you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_21" data-id="EK22_21">It will be as though I am blowing on you with a hot breath that shows that I am very angry, and it will be as though you will melt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_22" data-id="EK22_22">as though you will melt like silver melts in a furnace, and then you will know that I, Yahweh, have punished you."</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_23" data-id="EK22_23">Yahweh gave me another message. He said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_25" data-id="EK22_25">Their leaders are like lions that tear apart the animals that they have killed. The leaders destroy their people. They steal treasures and other valuable things from people, and they murder many men and make their wives into widows.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_26" data-id="EK22_26">Their priests disobey my laws and dishonor my sacred things by saying that there is no difference between things that are sacred and those that are not sacred, and by ignoring my laws about resting on the Sabbath days. As a result, they no longer honor me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_27" data-id="EK22_27">Their officials are like wolves that tear apart the animals that they have killed. They murder people in order to get their money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_28" data-id="EK22_28">Their prophets try to cover up those sins by saying they have received visions from God. They say, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says,' when I have said nothing to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_29" data-id="EK22_29">The Israelite people force others to give them money, and they rob people. They oppress poor people, and they mistreat foreigners among them by not treating them fairly in the courts.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_30" data-id="EK22_30">I looked among them to find a man who would pray for the people and cause them to repent so that I would not need to destroy them. But I did not find anyone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_31" data-id="EK22_31">So because I am very angry with them, I will severely punish them for all the wicked things that they have done. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh the Lord, have said it."</span>
