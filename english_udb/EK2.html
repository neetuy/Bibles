They are people who have turned away from me and rebelled against me. Their ancestors rebelled against me, and they themselves are still rebelling against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_4" data-id="EK2_4">The people to whom I will send you are very stubborn. But say to them, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says to you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_5" data-id="EK2_5">And when you tell them my messages, perhaps those rebellious people will heed those messages and perhaps they will not heed them; but they will know that a prophet has been among them!</span>
