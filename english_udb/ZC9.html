<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_1" data-id="ZC9_1">This is another message that I received from Yahweh about the region of Hadrach and the city of Damascus, the place where they get their rest. All the eyes of the nations and the people of the tribe of Israel are all looking toward Yahweh, to see what he will say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_2" data-id="ZC9_2">This message is also about the people in the region of Hamath near to Damascus, and about the people in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, people who are very wise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_3" data-id="ZC9_3">The people in Tyre have built a high wall around their city. They piled up huge amounts of silver and gold like other people pile up soil when they dig in the streets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_4" data-id="ZC9_4">But I, Yahweh, will make them lose everything, including their ships in which their men fight on the sea. Their city will burn to the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_5" data-id="ZC9_5">The people in the city of Ashkelon will see that happen, and they will become very afraid. The people in the city of Gaza will shake because they are terrified, and the people in the city of Ekron will shake too, because they no longer hope to escape enemies. The king of Gaza will die; no one will live any longer in Ashkelon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_6" data-id="ZC9_6">Yahweh says, "Foreigners will occupy the city of Ashdod. I will no longer allow the people in all those cities of Philistia to be proud.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_7" data-id="ZC9_7">I will no longer allow them to eat meat that still has blood in it, and I will forbid them to eat food that they offered to idols. At that time, the people in the region of Philistia who survive will worship me; they will become like a clan in Judah. The people of the city of Ekron will become part of my people, as the people of the city of Jebus did when the Israelites conquered them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_8" data-id="ZC9_8">I will protect my land, and I will not allow any enemy soldiers to enter it. No enemies will harm my people again, because I myself will be watching over them carefully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_9" data-id="ZC9_9">Rejoice very much, you people of Jerusalem and shout joyfully,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v ZC9_9" data-id="ZC9_9">because your king will be coming to you.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v ZC9_9" data-id="ZC9_9">He is righteous and victorious;</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v ZC9_9" data-id="ZC9_9">he will be gentle,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v ZC9_9" data-id="ZC9_9">and he will be riding on a donkey,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v ZC9_9" data-id="ZC9_9">on a young female donkey.</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_10" data-id="ZC9_10">I will destroy the chariots in the region of Ephraim that are used in war and all the horses in Jerusalem that they take into battle. I will break all the bows they use in wars.</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v ZC9_10" data-id="ZC9_10">Your king will proclaim that he will cause things to go well and peacefully among the nations. He will rule the area from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea, and from the Euphrates River to the most distant places on the earth.</div>
</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_11" data-id="ZC9_11">As for you, my people of Jerusalem, because of the blood that flowed when I made my covenant with you, I will free your people whom they took to other countries, where it was as though they were prisoners in a waterless pit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_12" data-id="ZC9_12">You people who were prisoners in those countries who still believe that I will help you, return to Judah, for I will defend you there. Today I declare that I will give you two blessings for each of the troubles that you have experienced.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_13" data-id="ZC9_13">I will cause Judah to be like my bow, and I will cause Israel to be like my arrow. I will enable you young men of Jerusalem to fight against the soldiers of Greece; you will be like a warrior's sword."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_14" data-id="ZC9_14">One day Yahweh will appear in the sky above his people, and the arrows that he shoots will be like lightning bolts. Yahweh our Lord will blow his trumpet, and he will march with the powerful storms that come from the land of Teman in the south.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_15" data-id="ZC9_15">Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, will protect his people; the soldiers of Judah will attack and defeat their enemies who attack them using slings and stones. Those soldiers of Judah will drink and celebrate and shout like people who are drunk; they will be as full of wine as the bowl that holds the blood of the animals priest kill at the altarâ€”the blood that the priests sprinkle on the corners of the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_16" data-id="ZC9_16">On that day, Yahweh our God will save his people like a shepherd saves his flock of sheep from danger. In our land, they will be like jewels that sparkle in a crown.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_17" data-id="ZC9_17">They will be delightful and beautiful. The young men will become strong from eating grain, and the young women will become strong from drinking new wine.</span>
