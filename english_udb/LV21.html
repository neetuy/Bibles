<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV21_2" data-id="LV21_2">'You priests must not cause yourselves to become unfit to do my work by touching any dead body.

<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV21_11" data-id="LV21_11">He must not enter any place where there is a corpse. He must not do that and cause himself to become unfit for his work, even if it is his father or his mother who has died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV21_12" data-id="LV21_12">He must not leave the sacred tent to join those who are mourning, because he would cause himself to become unfit for his work and would also defile the sacred tent. He must not leave the sacred tent at that time, because by being anointed with olive oil he has been appointed to serve his God in the sacred tent. I, Yahweh, am the one who am commanding this.</span>
