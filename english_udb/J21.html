<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_1" data-id="J21_1">You all know me as the chief Elder. I am writing this letter to you believers, the congregation that I love so much. God has chosen you, and I love you because what we know about the Messiah is true! Not only do I myself love you, but all those who know and accept the true message that Jesus taught also love you!</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_2" data-id="J21_2">This is because all of us believe God's true message. It is in our inner beings and we will continue to believe it forever!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_3" data-id="J21_3">God the Father and Jesus the Messiah, who is his Son, will continue to act kindly and mercifully toward us because they love us. They will enable us to have peace, because they truly love us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_4" data-id="J21_4">I am very happy because I have learned that some of you are living according to the truth that God has taught us. this is just what our Father commanded us to do.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_5" data-id="J21_5">And now, dear congregation, I beg you to obey what he has commanded us to do. This is why I am writing to you. What he commanded—that we should love each other—is nothing new; instead, it was when we first believed in the Messiah that we learned that we should love each other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_6" data-id="J21_6">This is what it means to love God and each other—we should obey what God commands us to do. What he commands us to do is love him and each other.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_7" data-id="J21_7">Many people who deceive others have left your congregation and have now gone out among other people in your area. They are the ones who refuse to believe that Jesus the Messiah became human. They are the ones who deceive others and oppose the Messiah himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_8" data-id="J21_8">So be careful that you do not let those teachers deceive you! If you let them deceive you, you will lose the reward which we, together with you, have been working for, and you will not receive the complete reward of being eternally united to God!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_9" data-id="J21_9">Those who change what the Messiah taught and do not continue to believe what he taught are not joined with God. But those who continue to believe what the Messiah taught are joined with both God, our Father, and with his Son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_10" data-id="J21_10">So when anyone comes to you who teaches something different from what the Messiah taught, do not welcome him into your homes! Do not encourage him by greeting him or wishing him well in any way!</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_11" data-id="J21_11">I say that because if you treat people like that as you would treat a fellow believer, you are helping them do their evil deeds.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_12" data-id="J21_12">Even though I have much more that I want to tell you, I have decided not to say it in a letter. Instead, I expect to be with you soon and talk directly with you. Then we can be completely joyful together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_13" data-id="J21_13">Your fellow believers in the congregation here, whom God has also chosen, all greet you. </span>
