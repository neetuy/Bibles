<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_19" data-id="GN25_19">This is what happened concerning Abraham's son, Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_20" data-id="GN25_20">When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel.

<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_21" data-id="GN25_21">For a long time after they were married, Rebekah still had no children. So Isaac prayed to Yahweh concerning his wife, and Yahweh answered his prayer. His wife Rebekah became pregnant.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_23" data-id="GN25_23">Yahweh said to her, "Two nations will come from the twins within you.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_24" data-id="GN25_24">When Rebekah gave birth, it was true! Twin boys were born!</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_25" data-id="GN25_25">The first one born was red, and his body had hair all over it, like a garment made of hair. So they named him Esau.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_26" data-id="GN25_26">Then his brother was born, grasping Esau's heel. So they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_27" data-id="GN25_27">When the boys grew up, Esau became a very good hunter of wild animals. He spent a lot of time out in the fields. However, Jacob was a quiet man who stayed close to the campsite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_28" data-id="GN25_28">Isaac liked Esau more, because he enjoyed the taste of the meat of the animals that Esau killed. But Rebekah liked Jacob more.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_29" data-id="GN25_29">One day while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came home from the field, very hungry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_30" data-id="GN25_30">He said to Jacob, "Give me some of that red stew to eat right now, because I am starving!" (That is why Esau's other name was Edom.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_31" data-id="GN25_31">Jacob said, "I will give you some if you sell me your right as firstborn to inherit most of our father's wealth."</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_32" data-id="GN25_32">Esau replied, "Well, I am about to die from being so hungry. If I die now, my rights will not help me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_33" data-id="GN25_33">Jacob said, "Swear to me that you are giving me your rights as firstborn!" So that is what Esau did. He sold his firstborn rights to Jacob.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN25_34" data-id="GN25_34">Then Jacob gave to Esau some bread and some stew made of lentils. Esau ate and drank, and then he got up and left. By doing that, Esau showed that he was not interested in his rights as firstborn.</span>
