<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_1" data-id="LK18_1">Jesus told his disciples another story to teach them that they ought to pray continually and not become discouraged if God does not immediately answer their prayers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_2" data-id="LK18_2">He said, "In a certain city there was a judge who did not revere God and did not care about people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_3" data-id="LK18_3">There was a widow in that city who kept coming to that judge, saying, 'Please get justice for me from the man who is opposing me in court.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_4" data-id="LK18_4">For a long time the judge refused to help her. But later, he said to himself, 'I do not revere God and I do not care about people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_5" data-id="LK18_5">but this widow keeps bothering me! So I will judge her case and make sure she is treated fairly, because if I do not do that, she will exhaust me by continually coming to me!'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_6" data-id="LK18_6">Then the Lord Jesus said, "Think carefully about what the unjust judge said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_7" data-id="LK18_7">Even more certainly will God, who is just, bring about justice for his chosen people, who pray earnestly to him night and day! And he is always patient with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_8" data-id="LK18_8">I tell you, God will quickly do justice for his chosen ones! Nevertheless when I, the Son of Man, come back to earth, there will still be many people who do not believe in me."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_9" data-id="LK18_9">Then Jesus also told the following story to some people who thought they were righteous and who looked down on other people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_10" data-id="LK18_10">He said, "Two men went up to the temple in Jerusalem to pray. One of the men was a Pharisee. The other was someone who collected taxes from the people for the Roman government.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_11" data-id="LK18_11">The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself in this way, 'O God, I thank you that I am not like other people. Some steal money from others, some treat others unjustly, and some commit adultery. I do not do any of those things. And I am certainly not like this sinful tax collector who cheats people!</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_12" data-id="LK18_12">I fast two days every week and I give to the temple ten percent of all that I earn!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_13" data-id="LK18_13">But the tax collector stood far away from the other people in the temple courtyard. He would not even look up toward heaven. Instead, he beat on his chest and said, 'O God, please be merciful to me and forgive me, because I am a terrible sinner!'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_14" data-id="LK18_14">Then Jesus said, "I tell you that the tax collector was forgiven as they left to go home, but not the Pharisee. This is because everyone who exalts himself will be made humble, and everyone who humbles himself will be exalted."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_15" data-id="LK18_15">One day people were bringing even their babies to Jesus so that he would put his hands on them and bless them. When the disciples saw this, they told them not to do that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_16" data-id="LK18_16">But Jesus called for the children to be brought to him. He said, "Let the little children come to me! Do not stop them! It is humble and trusting people like these children over whom God will agree to rule.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_17" data-id="LK18_17">Indeed I say to you that whoever does not accept with humility like a child for God to rule over them, God will not accept that person at all."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_18" data-id="LK18_18">Once a Jewish leader asked Jesus, "Good teacher, what must I do in order to have eternal life?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_19" data-id="LK18_19">Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? God is the only one who is truly good!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_20" data-id="LK18_20">In answer to your question, certainly you know the commandments that God gave to Moses for us to obey: 'Do not commit adultery, do not murder anyone, do not steal, do not give a false report, honor your father and mother.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_21" data-id="LK18_21">The man said, "I have obeyed all those commandments ever since I was young."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_22" data-id="LK18_22">When Jesus heard him say that, he replied to him, "You still need to do one more thing. Sell all that you own. Then give the money to people who have very little to live on. The result will be that you will have spiritual riches in heaven. Then come and be my disciple!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_23" data-id="LK18_23">The man became very sad when he heard that, because he was extremely rich.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_24" data-id="LK18_24">When Jesus saw how sad the man was, he too became very sorrowful. He said, "It is very difficult for those who are wealthy to agree for God to rule over them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_25" data-id="LK18_25">In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for rich people to let God rule their lives."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_26" data-id="LK18_26">Those who heard Jesus say that replied, "Then it seems that no one can be saved!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_27" data-id="LK18_27">But Jesus said, "What is impossible for people is possible for God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_28" data-id="LK18_28">Then Peter said, "Look, we have left everything we had in order to become your disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_29" data-id="LK18_29">Jesus said to them, "Yes, and I also tell you that those who have left their homes, their wives, their brothers, their parents, or their children in order to submit to God's will for them</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_30" data-id="LK18_30">will receive in this life many times as much as they left behind, and in the coming age they will receive eternal life."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_31" data-id="LK18_31">Jesus took the twelve disciples to a place by themselves and said to them, "Listen carefully! We are now going up to Jerusalem. While we are there, everything that the prophets wrote long ago about me, the Son of Man, will be accomplished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_32" data-id="LK18_32">My enemies will put me into the power of the non-Jews. They will mock me, treat me with disdain, and spit on me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_33" data-id="LK18_33">They will whip me and then they will kill me. But on the third day after that I will become alive again."</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_34" data-id="LK18_34">But the disciples did not understand any of those things that he said. God prevented them from understanding the meaning of what he was telling them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_35" data-id="LK18_35">As Jesus and his disciples came near to the city of Jericho, a blind man was sitting beside the road. He was begging for money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_36" data-id="LK18_36">When he heard the crowd of people passing by, he asked someone, "What is happening?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_37" data-id="LK18_37">They told him, "Jesus, the man from the town of Nazareth, is passing by."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_38" data-id="LK18_38">He shouted, "Jesus, you who are descended from King David, have pity on me!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_39" data-id="LK18_39">Those who were walking at the front of the crowd scolded him and told him to be quiet. But he shouted even more loudly, "You who are descended from King David, have pity on me!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_40" data-id="LK18_40">Jesus stopped walking and commanded the people to bring the man to him. When the blind man came near, Jesus asked him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_41" data-id="LK18_41">"What do you want me to do for you?" He replied, "Lord, I want you to enable me to see!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_42" data-id="LK18_42">Jesus said to him, "Then see! Because you have trusted in me, I have healed you!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_43" data-id="LK18_43">Immediately he was able to see. And he went with Jesus, praising God. And when all the people there saw this, they also praised God.</span>
