<div class="c">2</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_1" data-id="EP2_1">Before you trusted the Messiah you were powerless to obey God. You were as helpless as a person who is dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_2" data-id="EP2_2">You were like most people in the world today, and you, too, did what Satan wants—Satan is the ruler the evil spirits who have such power over the world. Satan is the evil spirit who is at work in the lives of people who disobey God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_3" data-id="EP2_3">We were at one time among those who disobeyed God; we did the evil things that we desired, things that would bring pleasure to our bodies and our minds. So God was very angry with us, just as with the others.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_4" data-id="EP2_4">But God acts very mercifully, and he loves us very much.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_5" data-id="EP2_5">We were like dead people, powerless to obey God, but then he made us live again by joining us to the Messiah. God has saved us because he has been very, very kind to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_6" data-id="EP2_6">He raised us up from among those who are like dead people, and he gave us seats of honor to rule with the Messiah Jesus in heavenly places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_7" data-id="EP2_7">He did this to show in future times how kind he has been to us, for we are joined to the Messiah Jesus.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_8" data-id="EP2_8">For God has saved you from his punishment by his extreme kindness given to you because you trust Jesus. You have not saved yourselves; this is a gift from God—</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_9" data-id="EP2_9">a gift that no one can earn, so no one can boast and say that he has saved himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_10" data-id="EP2_10">So God has created us as new people joined to the Messiah Jesus, so we can do good things—things that God planned long ago for us to do.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_11" data-id="EP2_11">Do not forget that you non-Jewish believers were previously called Gentiles because you were not born as Jews. The Jews insulted you by calling you "uncircumcised pagans." They call themselves "the circumcision"; by this they mean that they, not you, are God's people, although circumcision is something that only humans do, not God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_12" data-id="EP2_12">At that time, you did not have any part of the Messiah and you were not part of his people Israel. You did not know God's promises and law. You did not have confidence in the future that God promised you, and as you lived your lives, you did not know God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_13" data-id="EP2_13">But now because of what the Messiah Jesus has done, you have been able to trust in him because the Messiah agreed to die on the cross.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_14" data-id="EP2_14">The Messiah has brought peace and unity between Jews and non-Jews by destroying the barrier between us, as if he had destroyed a wall of hate that separated our peoples from one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_15" data-id="EP2_15">He made it no longer necessary for us to obey all the Jewish laws and commandments. He made Jews and non-Jews into one people instead of two because he made peace between us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_16" data-id="EP2_16">Jesus caused Jews and non-Jews together to both become friends with God in one new group of believers. By dying on the cross, Jesus made it possible for them to stop hating each other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_17" data-id="EP2_17">Jesus came and proclaimed the good news that brings peace with God; he proclaimed it both to you non-Jews, who did not know about God, and to us Jews, who did know about God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_18" data-id="EP2_18">Through Jesus both Jews and non-Jews now can speak with the Father because God's Spirit lives in all believers.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_19" data-id="EP2_19">Therefore now you non-Jews are no longer strangers and foreigners to God's people, but instead you are fellow members with those whom God has set apart for himself, and you belong to God's family for whom God is the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_20" data-id="EP2_20">You are like stones that God has made to be part of his building, and the building is built on what the apostles and prophets taught. The most important stone, the cornerstone, of the building is the Messiah Jesus himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_21" data-id="EP2_21">Jesus is increasing his family of believers and fitting them together like a temple of stones is built and fit together, increasing as the Lord joins new believers to himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_22" data-id="EP2_22">Jesus is building you up together, both Jews and non-Jews, into one family in which God lives by means of his Spirit.</span>
