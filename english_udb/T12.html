<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_1" data-id="T12_1">The most important thing that I urge believers to do is to continually ask God for what they need. They should also pray to God for all other people, and they should be thanking God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_2" data-id="T12_2">They should pray for kings and for everyone who has power over others, so that we can live very peaceably as we do all that God and others consider to be right and proper.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_3" data-id="T12_3">It is good to pray like that, and it pleases God, who saves us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_4" data-id="T12_4">He desires to save all people. He wants everyone to fully know and accept his true message.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_5" data-id="T12_5">He is the only one true God! And there is only one person who talks to God on behalf of people. That person is the Messiah Jesus, who himself is a man!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_6" data-id="T12_6">He gave his life as a sacrifice in order to ransom all people, which showed at the proper time that God desires to save all people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_7" data-id="T12_7">God appointed me to declare this message and to be an apostle. I am telling the truth and am not lying! I teach the Gentiles that they should believe God's true message.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_8" data-id="T12_8">Therefore, I want men everywhere to pray and to lift up their hands to God in a way that he will accept. They should not be angry with anyone and they should not quarrel with anyone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_9" data-id="T12_9"> Women should wear modest and sensible clothing, and should not fix their hair in fancy/elaborate ways, nor wear gold jewelry, nor pearls, nor expensive clothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_10" data-id="T12_10">Instead, they should be doing things that women who claim to worship God should do; that is, they should be doing good deeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_11" data-id="T12_11">Women should learn quietly from the leaders of the congregation, and fully subject themselves to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_12" data-id="T12_12">I do not permit women to teach a man, nor to have authority over a man. Instead, women should listen quietly during the worship services.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_13" data-id="T12_13">Keep in mind that God made Adam first, and afterwards he made Eve,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_14" data-id="T12_14">and it was not Adam whom the snake deceived. It was the woman whom he completely deceived, so that she did what God had told her not to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_15" data-id="T12_15">But now God will accept women as they bear children if they continue to believe God, and if they continue to love others, and if they continue to conduct their lives like God wants them to, and if they continue to be modest.</span>
